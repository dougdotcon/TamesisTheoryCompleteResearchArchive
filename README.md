## 📜 The Manifesto: What This Repository Is

This repository contains the artifacts of an interdisciplinary research program investigating the **Limits of Mathematical Solvability** under physical constraints.

### ✅ What This Is

* A **Meta-Theoretical Framework** classifying mathematical problems based on the topology of their solution spaces.
* A formal distinction between **Class A (Rigid)** problems (solvable by geometric exclusion) and **Class B (Universal)** problems (resistant to exclusion, requiring thermodynamic selection).
* A collection of **Barrier Theorems** suggesting why classical methods fail for problems like $P \text{ vs } NP$ and the Riemann Hypothesis.
* A library of **Computational Evidence** simulating these structural barriers.

### ❌ What This Is NOT

* It is **NOT** a claim of having "solved" the Millennium Problems in the classical sense (ZFC derivation).
* It is **NOT** a "Theory of Everything" unifying Gravity and Quantum Mechanics (though it discusses their incompatibility).
* It is **NOT** a repository of "crank" proofs. All claims are conditional: *"If physically realizable, then stable."*

## 🏛️ The Architecture

The research is organized into three hierarchical layers:

### 1. The Core Theory: Thermodynamic Structuralism

* **Location:** [`THEORY_THERMODYNAMIC_STRUCTURALISM`](THEORY_THERMODYNAMIC_STRUCTURALISM/THEORY_FOUNDATIONS.md)
* **Concept:** Matches Abstract Math to Physical Reality via the **Realizability Filter**.
* **Key Result:** The "Landauer Wall" censorship.

### 2. The Meta-Theory: Structural Solvability

* **Location:** [`THEORY_STRUCTURAL_SOLVABILITY`](THEORY_STRUCTURAL_SOLVABILITY/ROADMAP_STRUCTURAL_SOLVABILITY.md)
* **Concept:** Explains the "cisma" between Geometry and Complexity.
* **Key Result:** The **Density Obstruction Meta-Theorem**.

### 3. The Case Studies (Applications)

* **Problem 01:** [**P vs NP**](PROBLEM_01_P_VS_NP/ROADMAP_P_VS_NP.md) (Thermodynamic Censorship).
* **Problem 02:** [**Riemann Hypothesis**](PROBLEM_02_RIEMANN/PAPER_RIEMANN_SPECTRAL_ORIGIN.html) (Spectral Stability).
* **Legacy Tracks:** [**TRI & TDTR**](THEORY_SUMMARY.md) (Physical Implementations).
