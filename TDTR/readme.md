# TDTR — Theory of the Dynamics of Regime Transitions

## Program Status: COMPLETE

**Stages 53-78 | 2026-01-23**

## Central Thesis

> **Physics resides in the laws governing TRANSITIONS between incompatible regimes, not in the regimes themselves.**

---

## Key Results

### 1. Structural Irreversibility

Proved that fundamental transitions (edges) form a **semigroup**, not a group. Inverse transitions (e.g., "quantizing gravity") are structurally forbidden.

### 2. Transition Atlas

Classified the fundamental edges of the physics graph:

| Transition | Class | Monotone |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Quantum -> Classical | D1 | vN Entropy |
| Ordered -> Random | D2 (U_{1/2}) | Disorder |
| QFT -> GR | D4 | Geometric Entropy |

### 3. Gravity as Interface

Established that General Relativity is the effective description of the **irreversible coarse-graining** of Quantum Field Theory. Gravity is an entropic force arising at the interface.

## Final Conclusion

The architecture of physics is a **Directed Graph** of incompatible regimes.
The laws of physics are the laws of the **Transitions (Edges)**.
Unity exists only in the **Limits of Coexistence**.
