A cognitive neural circuit biotype  
of depression showing functional  
and behavioral improvement after 
transcranial magnetic stimulation in the B-SMART-fMRI trial
We previously identified a cognitive biotype of depression characterized by 
treatment resistance, impaired cognitive control behavioral performance and dysfunction in the cognitive control circuit, comprising the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dLPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Therapeutic transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the left dLPFC is a promising option for individuals whose depression does not respond to pharmacotherapy. Here, 43 veterans with treatment-resistant depression were assessed before TMS, after early TMS and post-TMS using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a Go–NoGo paradigm, behavioral cognitive control tests and symptom questionnaires. Stratifying veterans at baseline based on task-evoked dLPFC–dACC connectivity, we demonstrate that TMS-related improvement in cognitive control circuit connectivity and behavioral performance is specific to individuals with reduced connectivity at baseline (cognitive biotype +), whereas individuals with intact connectivity at baseline (cognitive biotype −) did not demonstrate significant changes. Our findings show that dLPFC–dACC connectivity during cognitive control is both a promising diagnostic biomarker for a cognitive biotype of depression and a response biomarker for cognitive improvement after TMS applied to the dLPFC.
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and the lead -
ing cause of disability1. Despite the availability of multiple treatment 
options, we lack tests for identifying which treatment is most likely 
to benefit each individual. Most patients cycle through multiple trial-
and-error treatment trials, often over years and some patients become 
resistant to treatment. The need for precision treatments is especially 
urgent for veterans given the high prevalence of depression with 
comorbid conditions and a higher rate of suicide compared with the 
civilian population2. This need was corroborated by the launch of the  Scott Hannon Initiative for Precision Mental Health, which directs  
the US Department of Veterans Affairs to utilize methods such as func -
tional neuroimaging to tailor treatments to individuals3.
A growing pool of studies highlight that cognitive impairments 
occur with depression and are a major contributor to chronic dis -
ability across the lifespan of affected individuals4–7. These cognitive 
impairments can persist despite overall symptom relief during early-
to-mid adulthood8 and similarly predict poor response to antidepres -
sant medication in later-life depression9,10. We previously identified a Received: 29 August 2023

symptom severity (secondary outcomes).
Our findings demonstrate that before commencing TMS we can 
stratify individuals into those who have poor dLPFC–dACC connectiv -
ity (cognitive biotype +) and those with relatively intact connectivity 
(cognitive biotype −). Importantly, this stratification is clinically mean -
ingful for determining the subsequent trajectory of the response to 
TMS. Specifically, individuals with impaired cognitive control circuit 
function before commencing TMS show TMS-related improvement 
in connectivity and this improvement largely occurs after the early 
sessions of TMS. Consistent with our hypotheses, early connectivity 
improvement corresponds with improved cognitive performance and 
this association is dependent on pretreatment baseline stratification. 
Furthermore, connectivity changes statistically mediate improved per-
formance. By elucidating how specific neural mechanisms underlying 
cognitive impairments in depression are modulated by TMS and for cognitive biotype of depression in 27% of individuals with depression11. 
At the pretreatment baseline this biotype is characterized by impaired 
performance on tests of cognitive control, greater disability and dys-
function of the brain’s cognitive control circuit, in particular in the 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dLPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate 
cortex (dACC)11. Following treatment with pharmacotherapy, this 
biotype also shows comparatively low response and remission rates11. 
Furthermore, we found that pretreatment task-related connectivity of 
the cognitive control circuit also predicts pharmacotherapy outcomes 
and changes proportionally with treatment12. Thus, pretreatment 
cognitive control circuit function offers promise as a biomarker for 
stratification in precision mental health to help select those individu-
als who are less likely to respond to pharmacotherapy alone and may 
benefit from different therapeutic approaches.
Therapeutic transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has emerged 
as a promising therapeutic option for individuals whose depression 
does not respond to pharmacotherapy alone and who are at risk of 
chronic disability13. It involves the non-invasive application of elec -
tromagnetic pulses to specific regions of the brain, aimed at rectify -
ing the neural circuitry dysfunction underlying pharmacoresistant 
depression14–16. In the treatment of MDD, TMS is most frequently used 
to induce an electric field that results in the depolarization of neurons 
in the dLPFC17,18. The most common protocol for TMS delivery is once-
daily treatments for up to 30 sessions, followed by a taper13. However, a 
number of novel or alternative approaches have evolved in recent years, 
including the use of different parameters or protocols (for example, 
theta burst stimulation or accelerated TMS; reviewed elsewhere19–22).
Having shown that functional connectivity within the cognitive 
control circuit is a promising candidate biomarker for treatment 
response in MDD and that TMS targets the dLPFC, a core region within 
this circuit, we hypothesized that functional connectivity of the dLPFC 
would provide a promising biomarker to prospectively identify patients 
who are non-responsive to pharmacotherapy and likely to benefit from 
clinical TMS. In the present study we used functional magnetic reso -
nance imaging (fMRI) embedded within a large multisite clinical TMS 
program. We used a pre-specified stratified precision medicine design 
to quantify functional connectivity before the commencement of TMS 
over the dLPFC23. Informed by previous work that indicates that a large 
portion of symptom reduction may occur early24, we performed fMRI 
early in the TMS treatment process and again at the end of treatment 
to determine the timing and extent of change in brain connectivity 
dependent on the extent of pretreatment impairment. We evaluated 
whether early changes in cognitive control connectivity determine 
subsequent changes in both cognitive behavior and clinical symptoms, 
and whether the extent of the change in connectivity correlates with the magnitude of the clinical response.
A focus of the present study was the quantification of cognitive 
control circuit connectivity engaged by cognitive task demands. We 
focused specifically on connectivity between the dLPFC and dACC, 
another core region of the cognitive control circuit25,26, which is also 
impaired in the cognitive control biotype11. Previous neuroimaging 
studies investigating how connectivity between the dLPFC and dACC 
relates to TMS treatment response have largely done so using resting-
state fMRI. These studies suggest that TMS of the dLPFC might improve 
symptoms of depression by affecting the functional coupling between 
dLPFC and regions of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)15, although 
the putative therapeutic mechanism of TMS remains under study.
Consistent with the pre-registered aims of the present TMS study23, 
we first tested the primary hypothesis that task-related dLPFC–dACC 
connectivity within the cognitive control circuit would change in a 
session-dependent manner—from the pre-TMS baseline to post early TMS treatment through to the end of treatment (primary outcome)—
and that the extent of this change would be related to baseline stratifica -
tion by connectivity. We then tested the hypothesis that the magnitude 
of change in cognitive control connectivity would be associated with Table 1 | Participant characteristics

Results
Stratification according to cognitive control circuit 
connectivity
Baseline stratification was based on left dLPFC–dACC connectivity 
within the cognitive control circuit before TMS treatment (Table 1 ). The 
cognitive biotype ( n = 26) was defined as participants who had hypoc -
onnectivity of the left dLPFC and the dACC during the Go–NoGo task 
relative to a healthy norm. We labeled these participants as ‘cognitive 
biotype +’ . By contrast, those not in the cognitive biotype (n = 17) were 
defined as participants who have relatively intact connectivity of the 
dLPFC–dACC. We labeled these participants as ‘cognitive biotype −’ .  
The connectivity cut-off values for cognitive biotypes + and − were, 
respectively, <0 and ≥0, after expressing the connectivity values rela-tive to a healthy norm (more details in Methods).
Baseline stratification by cognitive control circuit function was 
reflected in a corresponding stratification according to behavioral 
performance in computerized tests of cognitive control performance 
collected using the cognitive test battery WebNeuro. At baseline, vet-
erans in the cognitive biotype + group were distinguished from the 
cognitive biotype − veterans by significantly worse cognitive control performance on the Go–NoGo test (t-statistic (t) = −2.127, degrees of freedom (d.f.) =31.398, P = 0.041, Cohen’s d = −0.759, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [−2.003; −0.042]; Fig. 1 ).
TMS restores cognitive control circuit connectivity
TMS produced an early improvement in cognitive control circuit con -
nectivity that was dependent on pre-TMS stratification. This early 
improvement was specific to veterans in cognitive biotype + and per-
sisted until the end of treatment. This effect of TMS by session and baseline stratification was reflected in a significant biotype by session 
interaction (F  = 7.485, d.f. = 2, P  = 0.001; values and change in Fig. 2 
and Supplementary Fig. 1, respectively, and Supplementary Table 1).
Follow-up tests showed that there was already a significant 
increase in connectivity after early treatment (t  = 4.784, d.f. = 73.7, 
P < 0.001, d = 1.114, 95% CI = [0.773; 1.876]) for veterans in cognitive bio -
type +, which remained higher than baseline post treatment (t  = 3.347, 
d.f. = 99.1, P = 0.001, d = 0.675, 95% CI = [0.661; 2.585]; values and change 
in Fig. 2  and Supplementary Fig. 1, respectively, and Supplementary 
Table 1). By contrast, no significant changes were observed for the cog -
nitive biotype − group at either time point (early treatment, t  = −0.581, 
d.f. = 68.7, P = 0.563, d = −0.140, 95% CI = [−0.834; 0.458]; and post treat -
ment, t = 0.995, d.f. = 97.1, P  = 0.322, d = 0.202, 95% CI = [−0.499; 1.501]; 
values and change in Fig. 2  and Supplementary Fig. 1, respectively, and 
Supplementary Table 1).
TMS restores cognitive control behavioral performance
Mirroring the findings for brain connectivity, we also observed early 
TMS-induced improvement in cognitive control performance that was 
specific to veterans in the cognitive biotype + group, and this improve -
ment persisted until the end of treatment, which was reflected in a 
significant biotype by session interaction (F = 4.178, d.f. = 2, P = 0.021; 
values and change in Fig. 2  and Supplementary Fig. 2, respectively, and 
Supplementary Table 2).
Follow-up tests showed that cognitive control performance had 
already significantly increased for the cognitive biotype + group after early treatment (t  = 3.862, d.f. = 51.6, P  < 0.001, d = 1.075, 95% 
CI = [0.513; 1.62]) and remained above baseline levels post treatment 
(t = 3.177, d.f. = 68.6, P = 0.002, d = 0.767, 95% CI = [0.764; 3.34]; values 
and change in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2, respectively, and Sup -

for the cognitive biotype − group at either time point (early treatment,

errors, and also expressed in s.d. units relative to a healthy reference dataset.

Connectivity improvement mediates behavioral improvement
Improvements in cognitive control circuit connectivity across sessions 
correlated positively with improvements in cognitive control perfor-
mance (Pearson’s r = 0.299, P = 0.004, 95% CI = [0.097; 0.477]; Fig. 3).
This association was due to the role of change in connectivity of 
the left dLPFC and dACC in causally mediating the change in cognitive 
control performance (average causal mediation effect = 0.140, 95% 
CI = [0.013; 0.30], P = 0.026; total effect = 0.431, 95% CI = [0.104; 0.740], 
P = 0.012; Fig. 4 ).
TMS reduces depression symptoms regardless of connectivity
Depression severity was measured at three time points: pretreat -
ment, post early treatment and post treatment. Regardless of the cognitive control connectivity at baseline, TMS resulted in reduced 
depression severity for all veterans (main effect of session, F  = 4.366, 
d.f. = 2, P = 0.016; values and change in Fig. 5  and Supplementary  
Fig. 3, respectively, and Supplementary Table 3). A significant decrease 
in depression severity was already observed after early treatment 
(t = −2.758, d.f. = 75, P  = 0.007, d = −0.637, 95% CI = [−3.24; −0.523]) 
and depression severity remained lower than baseline post treatment 
(t = −2.337, d.f. = 103, P  = 0.021, d = −0.460, 95% CI = [−6.23; −0.510]; 
values and change in Fig. 5  and Supplementary Fig. 3, respectively, 
and Supplementary Table 3).

between veterans in the two cognitive biotype groups (n  = 6 cogni -
tive biotype + and n = 2 cognitive biotype −; χ2 = 0.389, P = 0.533; Sup -

response and remission rates were 30.5% and 15.3%, respectively27.
Consideration of potential contributing variables
We tested whether our results held when considering other potential 
contributing variables, including activation of the cognitive control 
circuit, motion during fMRI and reproducibility of performance inside 
and outside the scanner.
First, other than cognitive control, no differences in domains of 
cognition at baseline were noted between veterans in cognitive biotypes + and −. From the WebNeuro tasks, we analyzed verbal memory, working 
memory (digit span) and sustained attention (continuous performance 
test), and found that the performance of the two biotypes did not sig -
nificantly differ in any of these (verbal memory, t = −0.404, P = 0.689, 
d.f. = 29.592, d = −0.148, 95% CI = [−0.787; 0.527]; working memory, 
t = 0.061, P = 0.952, d.f. = 26.321, d = 0.024, 95% CI = [−1.090; 1.157]; 
sustained attention, t  = 0.433, P = 0.668, d.f. = 29.229, d  = 0.160, 95% 
CI = [−0.397; 0.610]). They also did not differ in terms of symptom 
severity (Wilcoxon test statistic (W) = 201.5, P = 0.876), age (t = −0.747, 
P = 0.463, d.f. = 22.092, d  = −0.318, 95% CI = [−14.385; 6.768]) or sex 
(χ2 = 0.188, P = 0.664).
Performance while conducting the cognitive control test outside 
the scanner was correlated with performance in the same task inside 
the scanner, establishing the reproducibility of performance measures 
(Spearman's ρ = 0.313, P = 0.006).
The early improvement in cognitive control circuit connectiv -
ity following TMS that was dependent on pre-TMS stratification was still present when we accounted for activation of the cogni
-
tive control circuit as a covariate (t  = 4.574, d.f. = 76.1, d  = 1.049, 95% 
CI = [0.735; 1.868], P < 0.001; Supplementary Table 5) and the same 
was true for changes in cognitive control behavioral performance 
(t = 2.892, d.f. = 51.5, d = 0.806, 95% CI = [0.235; 1.298], P = 0.006; Sup -
plementary Table 6). As before, depression severity decreased similarly 
in both biotypes (early treatment, t  = −2.458, d.f. = 72.2, d  = −0.578, 95% 
CI = [−3.06; −0.320], P = 0.016; post treatment, t  = −1.996, d.f. = 95.1, 
d = 0.409, 95% CI = [−5.95; −0.017], P  = 0.049; Supplementary Table 7).
Similarly, scanner motion (defined as the number of volumes hav -
ing a framewise displacement of ≥0.3) did not change the significance 
of our findings when included as a covariate (early improvement in 
cognitive control circuit connectivity after TMS in cognitive biotype + 
veterans: t = 4.835, P < 0.001, d.f. = 73.1, d  = 1.131, 95% CI = [0.777; 1.867]; 
early improvement in cognitive control behavioral performance in cog -
nitive biotype + veterans: t  = 3.057, P = 0.004, d.f. = 49.4, d  = 0.870, 95% 
CI = [0.275; 1.331]; early improvement in depression severity regardless 
of cognitive biotype: t  = −2.379, P = 0.020, d.f. = 68.5, d  = −0.575, 95% 
CI = [−2.92; −0.257]; Supplementary Tables 8–10). In addition, motion 
did not show a significant effect in predicting changes in connectivity between the left dLPFC and dACC or changes in depression severity (all 
P > 0.05; Supplementary Tables 8 and 10). It did show a significant effect 
in predicting changes in Go–NoGo performance but as the addition of 
motion in the model did not change the significance of our predictor 
of interest (Biotype × TMS session), we did not investigate this further 
(Supplementary Table 9).
Furthermore, performance changes in aspects of cognition other 
than cognitive control following TMS were not related to changes in 
cognitive control circuit connectivity, thereby demonstrating that our 
findings were specific to cognitive control and not cognition in general 
(verbal memory, r  = −0.077, P = 0.468, 95% CI = [−0.278; 0.131]; working 
memory, r = 0.051, P = 0.643, 95% CI = [−0.163; 0.260]; sustained atten -
tion, r = 0.017, P = 0.876 and 95% CI = [−0.191; 0.223]).
At baseline, cognitive biotype + veterans had worse behavioral 
cognitive control performance compared with the cognitive bio -
type – veterans (t = −2.127, P = 0.041, d = −0.759). After early TMS, the 
cognitive biotype + veterans showed improvements in connectivity 
(t = 4.784, P < 0.001, d = 1.114), which persisted post treatment ( t = 3.347, 
P = 0.001, d = 0.675). Behavioral cognitive performance also improved 
(t = 3.862, P < 0.001, d = 1.075 and t = 3.177, P = 0.002, d = 0.767). There 
was no change in the cognitive biotype − veterans. Change in brain 
connectivity-mediated improvements in behavioral cognitive con -
trol performance (mediation effect = 0.140, P  = 0.026). Depression 
symptoms improved for all veterans (t  = −2.337, P = 0.021, d = −0.460).
Discussion
We show that the biotype of an individual at baseline is important for 
determining whether they experience early improvements in their brain 
connectivity and cognitive function when treated with therapeutic 
TMS. Individuals designated as cognitive biotype +, with poor con -
nectivity and cognitive control before commencing TMS, showed an 
early improvement in both of these measures after early TMS sessions 
and this improvement was maintained at the end of the therapeutic 
program. The magnitude of improvement in functional connectivity 
was directly correlated with improvement in behavioral performance as 
a function of their baseline biotype and the ‘dose’ of TMS they received, 
from the earlier to later number of sessions. In fact, change in brain con -
nectivity mediated improvements in the behavioral capacity to control 
cognitive performance, a capacity highly relevant to how individuals 
manage the demands of day-to-day function. These findings highlight 
brain imaging of functional connectivity during cognitive control as 
a promising precision mental health approach with utility to identify individuals who are most likely to benefit early from TMS, potentially helping to alleviate longer-term disability.
Our findings elucidate the neurobiological underpinnings of how 
TMS may improve function in depression. It might do so in part by mod -
ulating the neural circuits involved in cognitive control—in particular, 
connectivity between the dLPFC and dACC and the therapeutic effects 
of TMS on the cognitive control circuit may depend on the extent of 
impairment in these circuits. In this study we stratified individuals 
according to the extent of impairment in dLPFC–dACC connectivity 
elicited during a cognitive control task relative to a healthy norm. 
Individuals with less connectivity were designated as cognitive biotype 
+ and those with relatively intact connectivity as cognitive biotype −. Veterans in cognitive biotype + were distinguished by comparatively 
poorer performance on a behavioral test of cognitive control, verifying 
the connectivity-based stratification at baseline. This separation of the 
cognitive biotype group aligns with our previous work describing a cog -
nitive dyscontrol biotype in MDD, characterized by cognitive deficits 
detectable by behavioral testing and specific functional impairment of 
the cognitive control circuit11. Our demonstration that therapeutic TMS 
mediated improvements in dLPFC–dACC connectivity and cognitive control performance specifically in the cognitive biotype + suggests 
that this circuit connectivity measure has promise as a novel strati -
fication and TMS response biomarker for individuals experiencing 4

Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-024-00271-9cognitive impairment with depression. Use of connectivity biomarkers 
might help maximize the potential of TMS to ameliorate the cognitive 
impairments often associated with treatment-resistant depression, 
which contribute substantially to the disabling and chronic impact of 
this disorder. Given that the cognitive biotype + has been associated with a lower rate of response to antidepressant medication
11, the use 
of a biomarker to help expedite these individuals to augmentation 
with TMS could improve function and limit chronic burden of illness.
Although there was a tight coupling between TMS-induced 
improvements in both dLPFC–dACC connectivity and cognitive con-trol performance, relevant to functional outcomes, improvements in 
overall symptom severity were not dependent on baseline stratifica -
tion. This finding raises the interesting possibility that therapeutic 
TMS might play a critical role in reconfiguring neural connectivity to improve objectively tested cognitive function, whereas other factors 
or neural circuits might underpin the improvement in self-reported 
symptoms. Clinical assessment of depression requires that symptoms 
cause notable impairment in social, occupational or other important 
areas of functioning, and cognitive capacity is tied tightly to these. 
Thus, future studies are needed to determine whether the improve -
ment in behavioral performance in a cognitive control task following TMS that we detected is accompanied by an improvement in quality 
of life and everyday functioning rather than self-reported symptoms of depression.
Here we evaluated task-evoked functional brain connectivity as an 
imaging biomarker both for pretreatment stratification and for quan -
tifying TMS response after early treatment as well as after treatment. Our results suggest that such early sampling of mechanistic imaging 
information may be an important novel approach for future precision 
studies of brain stimulation15,28. Methodologically, our findings extend 
previous research showing that resting-state connectivity involving 
the dLPFC and other regions of the ACC (such as the subgenual ACC) 
predicts overall symptom outcomes29–31 and increases post treatment in 
TMS symptom responders32. Although resting connectivity has helped 
identify symptom responders, task-evoked dLPFC connectivity may 
be particularly pertinent as a biomarker of functional improvements in patients with task-related cognitive impairments. In these patients 
the improvement of cognitive control performance may be of benefit 
above and beyond the improvement in depression symptoms, espe -
cially in light of evidence that cognitive impairments can persist despite 
symptom response4,8. Interestingly, dLPFC connectivity evoked by the 
same cognitive task as used in the present trial has also been identified 0.698 (P = 0.0003)m, ∆ connectivity

Nature Mental Health
Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-024-00271-9as an important differential predictor of response to different types of 
antidepressant medications in depression12. Given that therapeutic 
TMS is currently given as an augmentation to ongoing pharmaco -
therapy, dLPFC connectivity has the potential to be a biomarker that 
helps identify the specific combination of TMS and medication to 
optimize functional improvements in depression.
Unfortunately, we can only speculate at the possible cellular 
effects of TMS within the described model, as cellular effects cannot 
be directly visualized in the human brain with the technology avail -
able at present. That caveat aside, because TMS works through local 
and distal effects (that is, localized depolarization of targeted neural 
populations coupled with modulation of large-scale neural networks), 
it would be reasonable to hypothesize that TMS is able to differentially 
impact the underlying etiology related to the cognitive biotype. One 
can imagine a pathological homeostasis exists in the cognitive biotype 
such that regional activity is insufficient to meet the cognitive needs 
of a patient and that TMS can disrupt this pathology acutely, and with 
longer-term administration induce a neuroplastic effect that yields 
longer-term disruption of the underlying pathology. This is supported 
by studies of in vitro and in vivo models that have shown that TMS 
increases the release of growth factors and changes to neurotransmit -
ter levels33–36. However, further research is required to understand the 
complex molecular signaling cascades and circuitry-based alterations 
that occur following rTMS.
Our results should be interpreted in light of certain limitations. 
The observed changes in functional connectivity and cognitive per-
formance were assessed in the context of a naturalistic TMS treatment 
regime of veterans and using self-reported symptom measurement. 
Further research is required to confirm these findings in broader clini -
cal settings. In addition, the changes we observed were detected at the 
end of TMS treatment but we did not assess whether they persisted 
beyond that. Future studies could examine whether these changes are 
sustained in the absence of TMS stimulation. We acknowledge that 
to define our cognitive biotype, we applied a cutoff on continuous 
baseline left dLPFC–dACC functional connectivity. Our approach was 
motivated by the clinical need for a stratification that would identify 
patients with functional impairment of the cognitive controls circuit 
and our rationale for choosing the mean of a healthy sample as the 
cutoff was based on ease of interpretation. Still, we acknowledge that 
binarizing a continuous variable comes at the price of loss of infor-mation. Moreover, the fact that we applied only one cutoff strategy is a limitation and future studies could investigate different cutoffs or try to identify an optimal cutoff for a given purpose (for example, 
treatment-response prediction). Furthermore, when separating 
veterans by biotype, the resulting groups were quite small. Future 
studies should apply our biotyping strategy to larger samples. The 
interplay of left dLPFC activation and connectivity after TMS is still unclear. Interestingly, when we added changes in left dLPFC activa-
tion to our models as a covariate, they did not significantly predict 
changes in cognition or symptoms, which suggests that although 
dLPFC activation might be a stratification biomarker of a cognitive biotype of depression
11, dLPFC–dACC connectivity might rather be 
a response biomarker. In addition, the specific mechanisms through 
which TMS brings about these neural changes and cognitive improve -
ments in a specific subtype of depression are not entirely clear and warrant further investigation.
In conclusion, this study shows that dLPFC–dACC connectivity 
measured during a cognitive control task is a promising biomarker for 
the stratification of a cognitive biotype of depression, which might be 
particularly suited to TMS treatment. This connectivity measure also 
offers a potential response biomarker for quantifying the trajectory of 
improvement in the cognitive biotype. These results have particular 
significance for the types of depression that are usually less responsive 
to pharmacotherapy and that dramatically impair function and quality 
of life. Our findings pave the way for delivering TMS within a precision mental health approach in which imaging biomarkers could be used for 
earlier identification of individuals that may be likely to benefit from TMS and an explanation for why.
Methods
Study design
The BiomarkerS for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Antidepres -
sant Response to Treatment-fMRI (B-SMART-fMRI) study followed a 
pragmatic precision medicine design. Veterans with MDD who were 
eligible for TMS in a neuromodulation clinic were offered participation. 
Biomarker measures of fMRI, cognitive behavioral performance and 
clinical symptoms were assessed at pretreatment baseline (within 72 h 
before their first TMS treatment), early in the treatment process (within 
24 h of their fifth TMS treatment) and post treatment (within 72 h of 
their thirtieth TMS treatment). The study design flow is explained in 
Supplementary Fig. 9 and the original protocol23. The trial was coordi -
nated through Stanford University and veterans were assessed at one 
of four clinics participating in the National TMS Clinical program27. The 
four clinics were located at four Veterans Affairs sites (each with affili -
ated universities): Palo Alto (Stanford University), White River Junction 
(Dartmouth College), Providence (Brown University) and Minneapolis 
(University of Minnesota). Each collaborating Veterans Affairs site is 
working closely with their local University to obtain brain scans. The 
study received Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for all corre -
sponding institutions and appropriate guidelines were followed (52695 
for Stanford University, 1594812-6 for Minneapolis Veterans Affairs 
Health Care System, 1633756-11 for Providence Veterans Affairs Health 
Care System and 1531845-1 for Veteran’s IRB of Northern New England). 
This trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under NCT04663481.
The partnership with the TMS National Clinical program enabled 
this trial to be undertaken in real world clinical settings. We also con-trolled the interpretation of clinical outcomes by comparing clinical 
symptom outcomes for participants who completed biomarker assess -
ments to those for the broader, generalizable sample of veterans in the 
national program.
Data in the present analysis are from the planned wave 1 midpoint 
of the trial.
Samples
The study aims to recruit 125 veterans (with an anticipated dropout 
rate of 20%) with treatment-resistant depression from the Veterans 
Administration Clinical TMS Program. Here, we focus on wave 1, the 
first 50% of samples.
Veterans completed an initial pre-screening to assess eligibility 
criteria. Inclusion criteria were: ≥18 yr old, meet the diagnostic criteria 
for MDD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders (DSM-5)37 as confirmed by the TMS physician, demonstrate 
pharmacoresistance by failing to respond to at least one antidepressant 
trial of adequate dose and duration, be capable of obtaining a motor 
threshold measurement before treatment, have stable medical condi -
tions, be able to maintain their current medication regimen throughout 
the treatment period, be able to participate in a daily treatment regi-men and possess the ability to read, understand and voluntarily sign 
the informed consent form. Exclusion criteria included: a history of 
seizure disorder; the presence of structural or neurological abnormali -
ties near the treatment site; a history of brain surgery; the presence 
of a pacemaker or a non-MRI-compatible medical infusion device; a 
history of traumatic brain injury within 60 ds of treatment initiation, 
severe or uncontrolled alcohol or substance use disorders; active 
withdrawal from alcohol or substances; the presence of an implanted 
device or metal in the head; severe impairment of vision, hearing or 
hand movement that would interfere with assessments or protocol 
adherence; a lifetime history of bipolar I disorder; inability to speak, 
read or understand English; plans to relocate outside the study area 
during the study period and exclusion at the discretion of the clinician

The participants were compensated for their time.
A total of 55 participants signed the informed consent form, 43 
of which completed fMRI at the planned wave 1 of the trial (mean age, 48 yr; 83.7% male and 16.3% female; Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 6 
for CONSORT chart). Of these, 33 completed all clinical follow-ups. All 
available data were used for our statistical analyses, including that of veterans with some incomplete time points.
In addition to these clinical samples, we used previously collected 
normative samples of 144 healthy controls (mean age, 32.16 yr; 50.7% 
male and 49.3% female; Supplementary Table 11) to quantify our imag -
ing measure of interest relative to a reference norm following a vali-
dated protocol38.
TMS protocol
Veterans received TMS treatment as part of their regular clinical 
care within the VA clinical TMS program. Thus, we followed all the 
procedures of the clinics within the program27. In summary, treat -
ment was delivered using Magstim devices with figure-of-eight coil  
(The Magstim Company Ltd). Head dimensions were measured to local -
ize the approximate area on the motor cortex controlling the left thumb 
using the Beam F3 method39. Motor threshold was generally identified 
using the parameter estimation by sequential testing program and 
reported as a percentage of maximal machine output40. Parameter 
estimation by sequential testing is an automated approach to establish 
resting motor threshold (available at clinicalresearcher.org). Briefly, TMS clinicians enter a starting energy level, monitor for movement in 
the contralateral hand and depending on a binary response (yes/no) 
about the presence or absence of movement in this hand, the algorithm 
will suggest the next intensity to assess. After a certain number of 
responses, it will converge on the resting motor threshold. The target 
of the stimulation was the left dLPFC. Further details on the treatment 
protocol are available in refs. 23 ,27.
Neuroimaging
Neuroimages were acquired using 3 T GE Healthcare Discovery MR750 
UHP (at Palo Alto) and 3 T Siemens Medical Solutions Magnetom Prisma 
Fit (at Minnesota, Providence and White River Junction) scanners. 
Details on all imaging data collected have been previously published23. 
The parameters of the sequences relevant to the current analysis are presented in the Supplementary Methods.
Task fMRI design. Task fMRI data were collected during a Go–NoGo 
paradigm to assess response inhibition and cognitive control (Fig. 1 ). 
This task is well normed across nine decades and has sound test–retest 
reliability41. It has been shown to robustly elicit inhibition errors in MDD 
and post-traumatic stress disorder12,42. In the Go–NoGo task, veterans 
respond via button press as quickly and accurately as possible to Go 
stimuli (the word ‘press’ in green) and withhold responses to NoGo 
stimuli (the word ‘press’ in red). There are 180 Go and 60 NoGo stimuli 
(ratio 3:1), presented pseudorandomly with a duration of 500 ms and 
jittered interstimulus interval of 750 ± 50 ms. Behavior was assessed 
with Commission NoGo errors and Omission Go errors.
Preprocessing.  The fMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using 
SPM version 8 ( www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) and FSL version 6 with 
default parameters, unless otherwise specified. Motion correction 
was performed by realigning and unwarping the fMRI images to 
the first image of each task run. For normalization to stereotactic 
Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, the T1-weighted data 
were normalized to MNI space using the FMRIB nonlinear registra -
tion tool, and the fMRI EPI data were co-registered to the T1 data 
using the FMRIB linear registration tool43. Normalization warps from 
these two steps were stored for use in functional-to-standard space transformations.Task analysis.  To compute task-related activations, the onset times of 
Go and NoGo stimuli were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic 
response function, and entered in a general linear model analysis as regressors of interest and the six realignment parameters as regres-
sors of no interest. A high-pass filter with a cutoff period of 128 s  
was applied.
The left dLPFC and dACC were defined as described previously38. 
Briefly, a search was conducted for ‘cognitive control’ in the meta-
analytic database Neurosynth44, the resulting map was thresholded 
at positive false discovery rate < 0.01, peak coordinates of the result-
ing clusters were identified and voxels at a maximum of 10 mm from 
these peaks were used to generate regions of interest. The peak for left 
dLPFC was at MNI coordinates −44, 6, 32 and that for dACC was at MNI coordinates 0, 18, 46. To quantify task-based functional connectivity, 
we computed psychophysiological interactions using the left dLPFC as 
a seed region. We calculated the first eigenvariate of the left dLPFC time 
series and fit a whole-brain general linear model as described earlier, 
which consisted of the psychological variable of interest (NoGo>Go 
contrast), physiological variable (left dLPFC time course) as well as 
the interaction between psychological and physiological variables 
(psychophysiological interaction effect of interest). Finally, the mean 
values of the psychophysiological interaction contrast were extracted 
from the left dLPFC.
Correction for scanner effects.  Before aggregating data collected on 
different scanners, we removed the potential confounding effect of 
between-scanner variability using ComBat45–47, an established method 
that uses an empirical Bayesian framework to remove batch effects.
Referencing to a healthy norm.  Left dLPFC–dACC NoGo>Go con -
nectivity was expressed in s.d. units relative to the mean and s.d. of 
a sample of healthy controls undergoing the same task (z -scores). 
Our approach to quantify participant-level measures of brain circuit 
dysfunction relative to a healthy norm is built on our previous work, 
in which we established this procedure38. Subsequent analyses were 
conducted only on the left dLPFC–dACC NoGo>Go connectivity of 
veterans with treatment-resistant depression.
Cognitive control performance . Computerized tests of cogni -
tive control performance were collected at baseline, after the fifth 
TMS treatment and post TMS treatment on a computer using the 
cognitive test battery WebNeuro. Psychometric properties for Web -
Neuro have been established and include norms, construct validity, 
validation against traditional neuropsychological tests evaluating 
equivalent functions, test–retest reliability and consistency across 
cultures48–53.
Here the main task of interest was a Go–NoGo task in which a 
word (press) is frequently presented in the color green (Go) and 
infrequently in the color red (NoGo). Veterans were asked to respond 
with a keypress when the word was presented in green and inhibit a keypress when it was presented in red. Inhibition was assessed with 
omission of keypress responses when the word ‘press’ was red. Behav -
ior was assessed in terms of Commission NoGo errors and Omission 
Go errors. The sum of Commission NoGo errors and Omission Go 
errors expressed relative to an age- and sex-matched healthy norm 
provided by WebNeuro was used for statistical analyses as the meas -
ure of cognitive control performance. Note that the Go–NoGo task 
is the same task that was performed inside the scanner during fMRI (described earlier).
We also obtained overall performance measures of verbal memory, 
working memory and sustained attention from WebNeuro and used 
these to test whether our behavioral performance results were spe -
cific to cognitive control (described below). The overall performance measure for each task was the mean of all the normed measures avail-able in that task.
Nature Mental Health
Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-024-00271-9Depression severity
Depression severity was assessed at baseline, after early TMS treat -
ment, and post TMS treatment using the QIDS total54. A participant was 
considered a responder to the treatment if they showed a decrease of 
QIDS total of more than 50% from baseline and they were considered a remitter if their post-treatment QIDS total was ≤5.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 4.1.3 using R Stu -
dio Version 2023.06.2+561. First, we divided the treatment-resistant 
depression samples into two biotypes based on their baseline left 
dLPFC–dACC NoGo>Go connectivity. Given that zero represented 
the mean of our healthy reference sample, the cognitive biotype was 
defined as participants who have hypoconnected left dLPFC–dACC 
NoGo>Go connectivity of <0 ( n = 26). We labeled these participants 
as cognitive biotype +. By contrast, those not in the cognitive biotype 
group were defined as participants who have relatively intact connec -
tivity of ≥0 (n  = 17). We labeled these participants as cognitive biotype 
−. This biotype variable was then used in subsequent models testing 
for the effects of baseline connectivity and TMS treatment on changes 
in connectivity, cognitive performance and symptom severity in time.
Effect of TMS on cognitive control circuit connectivity
We ran a linear mixed-effects model in which our pretreatment strati-
fication factor was cognitive biotype, our dependent measure was 
change in brain connectivity across TMS sessions and our focal effect 
of interest was the interaction of biotype and TMS session. In this 
model fixed effects were biotype (between participants, cognitive 
biotype + or −) and TMS session (repeated measure within participants, 
baseline, early treatment and post treatment) and we covaried for the 
continuous measure of days from baseline on the scan date. We tested 
the significance of the interaction using an F-test and used t-tests for planned contrasts between TMS sessions for each biotype.
This model implements the analytic strategy in our protocol23 and 
is designed to test the hypothesis that change in connectivity induced 
by TMS will be a function of pretreatment impairment such that when a 
binary grouping is used to define connectivity impairment at baseline, 
the trajectory of change in TMS-related connectivity will differ between 
veterans with hypoconnectivity (cognitive biotype +) and veterans with 
relatively intact connectivity (cognitive biotype −).
We took several analytic considerations into account. These 
included the emphasis on change in connectivity as our dependent 
outcome measure, a difference score value that is not fully determined 
by the single pretreatment raw value of connectivity. We also veri -
fied that TMS session and days from baseline were not colinear when 
entered in a linear model predicting difference in brain connectivity 
from baseline (variance inflation factors, 3.84 and 3.83, respectively). 
Furthermore, we incorporated random intercepts for each participant 
to account for any similarities between measurements taken from the 
same participant.
Effect of TMS on cognitive control performance
First, we compared cognitive control performance between veterans 
in the cognitive biotype + and − groups using a t -test. We then ran a 
linear mixed-effects model, with fixed effects of pretreatment biotype 
(cognitive biotype + or −), TMS session (repeated measure within 
participants, baseline, early treatment and post treatment) and the 
TMS-induced change in cognitive control performance as our depend -
ent variable. We covaried days from baseline on the cognitive test -
ing date (continuous) and incorporated random intercepts for each 
participant to account for any similarities between measurements 
taken from the same individual. Our primary effect of interest was 
the biotype by TMS session interaction and we tested its significance using an F -test and t -tests for planned contrasts comparing between 
sessions for each biotype.To further link the changes in left dLPFC–dACC NoGo>Go con -
nectivity from baseline and those in cognitive control performance 
across all sessions, we tested whether these were correlated using a 
Pearson correlation.
Mediation analysis of connectivity and behavior
To determine whether the changes in cognitive control performance 
were driven by those in functional connectivity, we built a causal 
mediation model using the ‘mediation’ package in R. In this model the independent variable was biotype (factor: cognitive biotype + or −),  
the mediator variable was change in left dLPFC–dACC NoGo>Go con -
nectivity from baseline and the dependent variable was change in 
cognitive control performance from baseline. We considered average 
causal mediation effects and average direct effects to be significant if P < 0.05.
Finally, we demonstrated generalizability of our cognitive control 
performance measure by conducting a Spearman correlation between 
total Go–NoGo errors in-scanner and out-of-scanner across all sessions.
Effect of TMS on depression severity
We ran a linear mixed-effects model using the difference in depression 
severity (measured by total QIDS) from baseline as our dependent vari -
able. As fixed effects in our model, we included biotype (factor: cogni -
tive biotype + or −), TMS session (factor: baseline, early treatment and 
post treatment) and their interaction, along with days from baseline 
on the symptom assessment date (continuous). We also incorporated 
random intercepts for each participant to account for any similarities 
between measurements taken from the same participant. Our effect 
of interest was the Biotype * TMS session interaction, and we tested its 
significance using an F -test. On finding a significant interaction, we fol -
lowed up the result with post-hoc t-tests comparing the two biotypes at each TMS session.
We also tested whether veterans in the cognitive biotype + had a 
higher rate of response or remission using a χ
2 test.
Left dLPFC activation, motion and other cognitive tests
To test whether the NoGo>Go activation of the left dLPFC (as opposed 
to the connectivity) influenced our results, all linear mixed models 
outlined above were rerun with NoGo>Go activation of the left dLPFC as a covariate.
Similarly, we tested whether in-scanner motion influenced our 
results by including the number of volumes with a framewise displace -
ment of ≥0.3 (ref. 55 ) for each session and participant as a covariate in 
all linear mixed models.
Finally, to test whether our behavioral performance results were 
specific to cognitive control, we compared the overall performance 
in WebNeuro tests measuring verbal memory, working memory and 
sustained attention of veterans in the cognitive biotype + and − groups. 
We also calculated the Pearson’s correlation between changes in left 
dLPFC–dACC NoGo>Go connectivity from baseline and those in per-formance in these tasks across all sessions.
