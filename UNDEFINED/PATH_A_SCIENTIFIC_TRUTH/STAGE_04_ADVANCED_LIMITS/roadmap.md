# STAGE 4: ADVANCED LIMITS (Formalism & Future)

**Status:** INITIALIZING

## Objective

To formalize the Tamesis/TDTR framework mathematically (Category Theory), scientifically (Killer Prediction), and technologically (Applications).

## 1. Mathematical Formalism: The Category of Regimes

**Goal:** Define TDTR not as a physical model, but as a structure in Topos Theory.

- **Objects ($Ob(\mathcal{R})$):** Physical Regimes $R_i = (S, P, O)$.
- **Morphisms ($Hom(R_i, R_j)$):** Transitions $T_{ij}$.
- **Axiom:** The Category is a **Strict Semigroup** (No inverses implies Arrow of Time).
- **Proof:** Show that the funtor mapping Quantum ($Hilb$) to Gravity ($Diff$) loses information implies Cohomology $\neq 0$.

## 2. The Killer Prediction: "The Void Anomaly"

**Goal:** A prediction where GR says X, MOND says Y, and TDTR says Z.

- **Candidate:** **Lensing in Cosmic Voids**.
- **Prediction:** TDTR predicts *excess* lensing in deep voids due to non-zero entropic potential of the vacuum memory (unlike GR which predicts zero, and MOND which scales with mass).
- **Formula:** $\delta \phi \propto \nabla S_{vac}$.

## 3. Technological Applicability: "Informational Work"

**Goal:** Physics of Information manipulation.

- **Concept:** $M_c$ Manipulation.
- **Application:** **Entropic Heat Engines**. Using information erasure at the $M_c$ scale to extract work from vacuum fluctuations.
- **Metric:** Efficiency $\eta = 1 - T_{cold}/T_{hot}$ replaced by Landauer Limit efficiency using Bit density.

## Execution

1. Python script to symbolic verify the Category logic (`category_proof.py`).
2. Python script to plot the Void Lensing prediction (`void_prediction.py`).
3. Write the concise sections for `index.html`.
