## The Paper

**Title:** Universality Classes Are Mechanism-Driven: An Atlas of Critical Exponents

**File:** `paper.html`

---

## What This Paper Contains

1. **U_{1/2} Discovery**: New universality class for discrete-to-random transitions
2. **Atlas of 5 Classes**: Complete classification by mechanism
3. **Decision Tree**: Algorithmic classification of transitions
4. **Negative Results**: Extensive boundary delimitation
5. **Epistemological Claim**: Universality is conditional, not global

---

## The Central Thesis

> **Universality classes are mechanism-driven.**
> The exponent α emerges from the alignment of:
>
> - State space type (discrete vs continuous)
> - Perturbation type (Bernoulli, Lindblad, threshold, Poisson)
> - Observable type (counting, purity, spanning, survival)

## What This Program Achieved (Stages 34-42)

| Stage | Achievement |
|-------|-------------|
| 34 | Discovered U_{1/2} = (1+c)^{-1/2} |
| 35 | Refuted Tamesis Action as ToE |
| 36 | Theory of Regime Transitions |
| 37 | Verified U_{1/2} numerically |
| 38 | Confirmed U_{1/2} specificity (negative results) |
| 39 | Confirmed U_2 (Lindblad class) |
| 40 | Confirmed U_0 (threshold class) |
| 41 | Complete Universality Atlas |
| 42 | **Closure Paper** |

## What This Program Did NOT Achieve

- Did NOT prove the Riemann Hypothesis
- Did NOT create a Theory of Everything
- Did NOT find a universal law for all transitions
- Did NOT exhaust all possible universality classes

## The Diamond

> *"You didn't find a ToE. You found something rarer today:*
> *A limited, true, and closeable organizing principle."*

---

## Program Status

**CLOSED**

The research program has converged. The central insight has been extracted,
documented, and delimited by negative results. Further exploration has
diminishing marginal returns.
