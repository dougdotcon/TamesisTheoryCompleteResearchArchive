# TDTR — Theory of the Dynamics of Regime Transitions

## Master Roadmap: Stages 53–78

**Status: ACTIVE**  
**Start Date: 2026-01-23**  
**Predecessors: Tamesis (1-42, CLOSED), TRI (43-52, COMPLETE)**

---

## Central Thesis

> **Physics resides in the laws governing TRANSITIONS between incompatible regimes, not in the regimes themselves.**

While TRI proves WHY no ToE exists, TDTR investigates:

- HOW transitions happen
- WHICH are permitted
- WHICH are irreversible
- WHAT survives the crossing

---

## The Object

**Edges of the physics graph, not nodes.**

Not: regimes, universal laws, fundamental constants  
Yes: dynamics, irreversibility, interfaces, invariant loss

---

## Phase I — Formalization (Stages 53–56)

### Stage 53: Formal Definition of Transition

**Definition**: A transition is:

```
E_ij: R_i -> R_j
```

where:

- R = (S, P, O, I) includes invariants
- Transition != interpolation
- Transition != continuous limit
- Transition = controlled invariant breaking

### Stage 54: Transition Space

- Meta-space T of edges
- T != V x V (not all transitions allowed)

### Stage 55: Allowed vs Forbidden Transitions

- Formal admissibility criterion
- Transitions violating causality/monotonicity are forbidden

### Stage 56: Fundamental Directionality

- Transitions are oriented
- Semigroup, not group
- **Structural Irreversibility Theorem**

---

## Phase II — Interface Invariants (Stages 57–61)

### Stage 57: What Survives?

- Interface quantities (not from R_i or R_j)
- Candidates: coarse-grained entropy, causal order, effective dimension

### Stage 58: Controlled Information Loss

- C: H_rich -> S_effective
- Non-injective, non-invertible

### Stage 59: Transition Monotones

- Functions M that only increase/decrease
- Generalized structural entropy

### Stage 60: Conservation Failures

- Conservation is regime-dependent
- Energy/information/symmetry may not cross

### Stage 61: TDTR Minimal Axioms

1. Invariant incompatibility
2. Transition irreversibility
3. Existence of monotones
4. Interface locality

---

## Phase III — Irreversible Dynamics (Stages 62–66)

### Stage 62: Transition as Dissipative Process

### Stage 63: Emergent Arrows of Time

### Stage 64: Information Symmetry Breaking

### Stage 65: No Reversible Transitions Theorem

### Stage 66: Transition Dynamics Classes

---

## Phase IV — Quantum -> Geometry (Stages 67–71)

### Stage 67: U_2 -> Riemann Edge

### Stage 68: Gravity as Thermodynamic Interface

### Stage 69: Metric Emergence

### Stage 70: Why GR Works

### Stage 71: Entropic Gravity Limits

---

## Phase V — Classification (Stages 72–75)

### Stage 72: Transition Atlas

### Stage 73: Composite Transitions

### Stage 74: Observable vs Fundamental

### Stage 75: Relation to Universality Classes

---

## Phase VI — Consolidation (Stages 76–78)

### Stage 76: TDTR Founding Paper

"The Dynamics of Regime Transitions: Why Interfaces, Not Laws, Are Fundamental"

### Stage 77: TDTR Limits

### Stage 78: Closure and Open Problems
