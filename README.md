# Tamesis Theory Research Archive

## Final Status

This archive documents a rigorous mathematical research program investigating the Hilbert-Pólya approach to the Riemann Hypothesis.

### Main Result

**No-Go Theorem**: No finite-difference discretization of $H = xp + V(x)$ on compact intervals can reproduce Riemann zeros.

**Reason**: Asymptotic mismatch — discretized $E_n \sim n$ vs Riemann $\gamma_n \sim n \log n$.

## Scientific Contributions

1. **Deficiency indices computed**: $(n_+, n_-) = (1,1)$ for xp operator
2. **600+ configurations tested**: domains, weights, boundary conditions, potentials
3. **Asymptotic obstruction identified**: Linear vs logarithmic spectral growth
4. **No-go theorem established**: Local discretizations structurally cannot work
