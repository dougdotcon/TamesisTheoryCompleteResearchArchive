> **"The universe is not a set of equations; it is a distributed computation minimizing its own processing cost."**

This repository contains the complete research archive of the **Tamesis Kernel**, a unified theory of physics, logic, and information. Tamesis resolves the Conflict of Continuity by proving that Spacetime, Matter, and Gravity are emergent statistical properties of a discrete informational graph.

## 🗺️ The Trinity of Tamesis

The Kernel v3.2 provides a simultaneous resolution to the three pillars of human knowledge:

1. **The Foundation (P vs NP):** Resolved as **P ≠ NP** via **Thermodynamic Censorship**. Computation requires physical bandwidth; the universe proíbes exponential "Oracles" through entropy.
2. **The Structure (Gravity):** Derived **Einstein's Field Equations** as the macroscopic limit of graph diffusion. Validated against **Fermi-LAT** and **IXPE** data.
3. **The Content (Matter):** Resolved the **Yang-Mills Mass Gap** and **Quark Confinement** as topological invariants of the graph. Verified against **LHC 13 TeV** cross-sections.
