Affect regulation processes ABSTRACT  
Background and Objectives: Patients with chronic mood and anxiety disorders experience many life stressors and 
are more reactive to these stressors. Although mindful yoga might reduce stress reactivity, little is known about 
the affect regulation mechanisms involved, such as repetitive negative thinking, fear of emotion, acting with 
awareness and body awareness. 
Design and Methods: Using experience sampling methodology, 12 patients with chronic mood and anxiety dis-
orders completed five daily assessments for 15 days before and after a 9-week mindful yoga intervention. 
Interrupted time-series analyses were used to assess mean-level change from pre-to-post intervention and vector 
autoregressive models to assess change in the temporal associations. 
Results: Most individuals experienced positive changes in affect and the proposed affect regulation processes. 
Fear of emotion showed changes from pre-to-post intervention for most individuals (67%), followed by acting 
with awareness (58%), body awareness (58%) and repetitive negative thinking (50%). In the dynamic re-
lationships between stressors, the four affect regulation processes and affect, there were individual differences in 
which pathways changed and how they changed. 
Conclusions: After a mindful yoga intervention, affect and several affect regulation processes improve in most 
individuals. Achieving this in the context of daily life stress, seems to be more complicated.

1.Introduction 
1.1. Stress (reactivity) in chronic mood and anxiety disorders 
Nearly half of the population experiences a mood or anxiety disorder 
during their life [1]. For many individuals, these disorders have a 
chronic course [2]. Recently, common factors instead of differences 
between mood and anxiety disorders have been emphasized by research, 
such as underlying transdiagnostic processes involved in the onset and 
maintenance of both disorders [3–5]. One such transdiagnostic process 
is stress reactivity; individuals with chronic mood and anxiety disorders 
may be more reactive to stressors. For example, depressive symptoms have been associated to increased negative affective responses to stress 
[6], and both patients with mood and anxiety disorders respond with an 
increase in anxious mood on daily negative life events [7]. Furthermore, 
increased reactivity to stress seems to predict persistence or worsening 
of symptoms of anxiety and depression [8]. These studies suggest that 
patients with chronic mood and anxiety disorders are more reactive to 
stressors and that such reactivity predicts poor long-term outcomes. 
Therefore, it is of particular importance to find ways to reduce affective 
reactivity to stressors in chronic mood and anxiety disorders.

21.2. Mindful yoga as an intervention to target stress reactivity 
Mindful yoga represents one potential way of reducing reactivity to 
stressors, due to this intervention ’s combination of yoga postures, 
breathing and meditative techniques with a focus on developing a 
mindful awareness of bodily sensations, emotions and thoughts. These 
ingredients have been found to reduce stress in healthy adults [9–11]. In 
healthy adults, yoga interventions have led to decreased subjective 
feelings of stress [12], and in healthy adults, and patients with somatic 
or psychiatric disorders, yoga was found to improve stress-related 
physiological parameters [13]. These results indicate that mindful 
yoga may improve stress reactivity. 
Little is known about the affect regulation processes by which 
mindful yoga might reduce stress reactivity. Theoretically, mindful yoga 
could reduce stress reactivity by targeting mechanisms associated with 
stress reactivity, that are involved in the maintenance of symptoms of 
depression and anxiety. One such potential process is repetitive negative 
thinking, defined as “excessive and repetitive thinking about […] cur-
rent concerns, problems, past experiences or worries about the future ” 
[14], which has been shown to contribute to the maintenance of both 
depression and anxiety [14,15] , and to be involved in the relationship 
between stress and symptoms of depression and anxiety [16]. A second 
potential process is fear of emotion, which is a fear of “the loss of control 
of one’s emotions and one’s reaction to those emotions ” [17], and found 
to be associated with coping strategies such as suppression and avoid -
ance. These strategies have been found to be maintaining factors in both 
mood and anxiety disorders [18], and to be associated with higher stress 
reactivity [19]. A third potential process is acting with awareness, an 
aspect of mindfulness skills, defined as “enhanced attention to and 
awareness of current experience or present reality ” [20]. Acting with 
awareness has been found to negatively correlate with stress reactivity 
[21], to moderate the relationship between life hassles and symptoms of 
depression [22], and to be associated with both symptoms of depression 
and anxiety [23]. A fourth potential process is body awareness, the 
ability to recognize internal bodily signals as well as to adequately 
respond to these sensations, with a nonjudgmental observation of the 
signals as an important factor [24]. This accepting attitude was shown to 
be a protective factor in stress reactivity [25], and to be mediating the 
relationship between mindfulness training and symptoms of depression 
and anxiety [26]. In summary, these four affect regulating processes that 
are involved in stress reactivity and associated with symptoms of both 
mood and anxiety disorders might be influenced by mindful yoga. 
Pioneering experimental studies indeed found evidence that yoga 
interventions may alter each of the proposed affect regulation processes. 
Specifically, yoga participants report less rumination [27], lower 
avoidance and suppression [28], more acting with awareness [29], and 
more body awareness [30]. However, most existing evidence comes 
from studies using non-clinical samples or patients with acute depres -
sion and anxiety instead of a chronic form. This makes it difficult to draw 
conclusions about patients with chronic mood and anxiety disorders and 
the potential of yoga interventions to target stress reactivity in this 
group. Moreover, existing research uses cross-sectional and experi -
mental designs with assessments pre- and post-intervention. Therefore, 
much remains unclear about the role of these processes in stress 
responsiveness in daily life. To examine whether a mindful yoga inter-
vention changes stress reactivity by means of the proposed pathways, it 
is important to assess these processes in daily life, in response to actual 
stressors [31]. This can be done with the experience sampling method 
(ESM), which is a method to map moment-to-moment changes in emo-
tions, experiences and behaviors in daily life, yielding high ecological 
validity [32]. Assessing such dynamics on a group level may obscure 
relevant individual differences [33] and therefore a study using ESM 
could be helpful. 1.3. Current study 
We examined within-person temporal associations between stressful 
experiences, negative affect and four affect regulation processes right 
before and after a 9-week mindful yoga intervention. Using ESM, par-
ticipants were assessed multiple times a day, creating longitudinal 
intensive time-series data. This allows to investigate temporal variation 
within the individual [33]. We hypothesized that after the mindful yoga 
intervention, there will be participants who show improved affect 
(H1a), and changes in the proposed processes, including reduced re-
petitive negative thinking and fear of emotion as well as greater acting 
with awareness and body awareness (H1b). We also hypothesized that 
there will be individuals for which the temporal associations between 
the variables would change in beneficial directions (e.g., a weakening of 
the positive association between stressful experiences and repetitive 
negative thinking) (H2). As an illustration of H2, Fig. 1 (left) shows the 
proposed dynamic connections before the mindful yoga intervention, 
whereas Fig. 1 (middle) shows the same proposed dynamic connection 
after the mindful yoga intervention, and Fig. 1 (right) shows the ex-
pected changes. At the start of the study, we expected that, when a 
stressful event occurred, repetitive negative thinking and fear of 
emotion would increase, and acting with awareness and body awareness 
would decrease, leading to lower affect balance (left). After the inter-
vention, we expected that, in case of a stressful event, all four affect 
regulating processes would change in a positive direction (i.e., repetitive 
negative thinking and fear of emotion would not increase very much, 
and acting with awareness and body awareness would not decrease very 
much; middle), leading to better affect balance. In sum, in case of a 
stressful event, we would expect repetitive negative thinking and fear of 
emotion to have decreased after the mindful yoga intervention, and 
acting with awareness and body awareness to increase, leading to better 
affect balance (right). 
In this study the focus on individual differences was important, as we 
expected at least three sources of relevant heterogeneity that might be 
obscured in a study on group-level. First, given the chronic character of 
the patient group, it can be expected that not all individuals will benefit 
from the intervention as is the case for most interventions [34]. Second, 
mindful yoga consists of different practices (e.g., different yoga postures, 
breathing and meditation practices) that each may have a different ef-
fect [34] and some participants might prefer one practice over the other. 
Third, mindful yoga addresses multiple possible mechanisms to reduce 
stress reactivity, and some individuals may be more likely to benefit 
from one particular mechanism, while others may benefit from multiple 
or all. 
2.Method 
2.1. Participants 
This study was planned and conducted following the guidelines of 
the CONSORT statement extension for N-of-1 trials [35]. Participants 
were recruited in November and December 2015 at the Center for 
Integrative Psychiatry at Lentis Psychiatric Institute in Groningen, the 
Netherlands, an outpatient clinic serving mostly patients with chronic 
mood and anxiety disorders. Inclusion criteria were (1) having a mood 
or anxiety disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder (based on DSM-IV 
as DSM-5 was not yet introduced in the Netherlands), (2) an illness 
duration of at least two years, (3) receiving current treatment as usual, 
(4) willingness to attend nine weekly sessions of mindful yoga, (5) fluent 
in Dutch, and (6) being ≽18 years. Exclusion criteria were (1) acute 
suicidality, (2) psychotic symptoms, and (3) substance abuse. Patients 
meeting the inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study by 
their therapists. Written informed consent was obtained from all par-
ticipants included in the study. After obtaining this, participants 
completed the questionnaires and received an explanation about the 
daily diary procedure (and smartphone, if necessary). N.K. Vollbehr et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Personalized Medicine in Psychiatry 45-46 (2024) 100123
3Fifteen participants entered the study, of whom twelve completed 
the intervention and at least 60 of 75 daily dairy assessments pre- and 
post-intervention. Three participants dropped out of the study, because 
of hospitalization, lack of motivation, and somatic illness, respectively. 
The Medical Ethical Committee of the University Medical Center Gro-
ningen judged the study protocol to be exempted from review by the 
Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (in Dutch: WMO) 
because it concerned a non-randomized open study (registration number 
2015/387). The study is registered in the ISRCTN register 
(ISRCTN13612864). 
2.2. Sample size 
For within-person analysis, the power is determined by the number 
of assessments completed by each individual. Previous studies show that 
at least 50 assessments are needed to identify bi-directional associations 
between multiple variables with a reasonable reliability, with higher 
numbers giving more power and more reliable results [36]. We therefore 
chose 60 (of 75) assessments to be the minimum number to be 
completed by each individual. 
2.3. Procedure 
The trial was conducted from January to April 2016. Participants 
started with baseline assessments consisting of several questionnaires. 
Thereafter, they started the ESM procedure, consisting of five ques-
tionnaires per day for 15 days. In order to set five fixed assessments 
points, 30 min were subtracted from the regular bedtime reported by the 
participant to schedule the last assessment of the day. The remaining 
assessments were scheduled before that moment, with intervals of 2.75 
h. All items and their responses were explained in the briefing. The same 
day, participants started with a two-day test phase using the fixed time 
schedule. Participants received a text message with a link to the ques-
tionnaires in RoQua (https://www.roqua.nl ), a secure online survey 
administration program, to complete on their smartphone, with one 
reminder message after 30 min of non-response. The questionnaire 
became inaccessible after 60 min of non-response. In the afternoon of 
the second day, the research assistant called the participants to answer 
any questions and make slight adaptations to the diary schedule, if 
necessary. The next day, participants started their 15 days of assess -
ments. Data collection was monitored and participants were approached 
by telephone if they missed more than two assessments over two days 
(this was the case for only one participant post-intervention). After the 
15 days, the mindful yoga intervention started. The day after the 
intervention ended, the baseline assessment and the 15-day ESM pro-
cedure, including a 1-day test phase, were repeated. 
2.4. Intervention 
The mindful yoga intervention was taught as a 9-week group 
training, with 1.5-hour weekly sessions, based on traditional yogic 
practices and texts that were adapted to a clinical setting for patients with mood and anxiety disorders, previously tested in a pilot study [37]. 
Currently, no information regarding the optimal length of a yoga 
intervention is yet available [38], therefore, the length and frequency of 
the mindful yoga intervention was based on comparable mindfulness- 
based training protocols, which have been found effective in reducing 
depression in adults [10]. In addition, the mindful yoga intervention 
matched the length and frequency of yoga interventions for (mental) 
health conditions used in previous studies [38]. The intervention was 
secularized, in that it omitted references to the Hindu background of 
yoga. The participants were informed about this background but 
instructed that the intervention would consist of breathing, yoga pos-
tures, and meditation practices without reference to the religious 
background or other ethical or philosophical ideas that are part of 
traditional yoga. The first author (a psychologist and a Registered Yoga 
Teacher 200 with over ten years of yoga experience and over two years of 
teaching experience) instructed the sessions. Participants received a 
manual with weekly home practice forms and videos. We recommended 
a daily practice of 30–45 min; however, this was not tracked. When 
necessary, adaptations of postures were given (e.g., no full standing 
forward bend for a participant with high blood pressure). Materials 
needed to adjust yoga postures was available. More detailed information 
about the intervention has been published elsewhere [37]. As the yoga 
teacher was also involved as a researcher, she was not involved in 
screening, or data collection at any of the assessment points. 
After the intervention the participants were asked to evaluate the 
mindful yoga intervention in terms of (1) overall quality and (2) quality 
of the teacher (both on a scale of 1–10). In addition, we assessed amount 
of practice and we used several questions to assess whether the mindful 
yoga intervention indeed led to more mindfulness. We assessed the two 
main facets of mindfulness – awareness and a nonjudgmental and 
accepting attitude [39]. For the first aspect (awareness) we used three 
questions to assess awareness of (1) bodily sensations, (2) feelings, and 
(3) thoughts and behavioral tendencies. For the second aspect 
(nonjudgmental and accepting attitude) we used four questions to assess 
accepting/nonjudgment of (1) self, (2) inner experiences, and (3) to 
what extend a participants was able to maintain a nonjudgmental atti-
tude in the here and now. For all these questions we used a 5-point 
Likert-type scale ranging from (1) Completely agree to (5) Completely 
disagree . 
2.5. Measures 
2.5.1. Questionnaires 
The baseline assessment included demographic measures. Informa -
tion about diagnosis, illness duration and current treatment duration 
was taken from each participants ’ medical files. Affect at baseline and 
post-intervention was measured with the Depression, Anxiety and Stress 
Scales-short form, a 21-item questionnaire [40]. Participants were asked 
to rate the way they were feeling over the past week, on a 4-point Likert- 
type scale ranging from never (0) to almost always (3). The scale showed 
good internal consistency (Cronbachs α 0.91).

Vollbehr et al.

42.5.2. Daily assessments 
As it was found that shorter diaries lead to better compliance [41], 
we decided to include eight affect items, one stress item and two items 
for each affect regulation process. Participants were asked to rate these 
items on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very 
much ), except for the stress item, where we used a scale ranging from  3 
(very relaxed ) to 3 (very stressful ). 
To get an indication of the composite reliability of the domain scores 
of positive and negative affect and each of the affect regulation pro-
cesses, we calculated the within-person omega (ω) with the function 
‘omegaSEM ’ of the R-package ‘multilevelTools ’ [42], which takes the 
multilevel structure of the data into account [43]. In addition, as there is 
disagreement about the best way to assess reliability for two-item con-
structs [44], we also calculated the Spearman-Brown correlations of the 
person-centered means for the affect regulating processes. 
2.5.2.1. Affect. Affect items were ‘blue ’, ‘fatigued ’, ‘anxious ’, ‘restless ’, 
‘energetic ’, ‘cheerful ’, ‘relaxed ’ and ‘calm ’. These were chosen along two 
bipolar dimensions of affect: unpleasant – pleasant and deactivated – 
activated [45] with the highest factor loadings from the Profile of Mood 
States Short Form [46] and the low negative affect scale from Watson 
and Tellegen [47]. The within-person ω was 0.712 (95 %CI 0.685, 
0.740) for the positive affect items and ω 0.531 (95 %CI 0.487, 0.576) 
for the negative affect items. Next, affect balance (a construct found to 
be associated with daily emotional experience [48]) was calculated by 
deducting the positive affect items from the negative affect items, with a 
positive score indicating more positive affect. 
2.5.2.2. Stressful events. Stressful events were assessed with one item: 
“Think about the most important event that has happened since the last 
assessment (or since getting up [for the first assessment of the day].). 
How stressful was this event? ”. 
2.5.2.3. Repetitive negative thinking. Repetitive negative thinking was 
assessed with one item from the Preservative Thinking Questionnaire 
[49], adapted to reflect the focus on negative thoughts: “Many negative 
thoughts are going through my head ”. The other item was taken from 
the Penn State Worry Questionnaire [50]: “I worry a lot”. The within- 
person ω was 0.788 (95 %CI 0.762, 0.813). The Spearman-Brown cor-
relation of the person-centered mean was 0.681. 
2.5.2.4. Fear of emotion. As feeling out of control with one’s emotions 
[17] and experiential avoidance [51] (as well as the opposite, accep -
tance of emotions) are both aspects of fear of emotion, we decided to 
operationalize this construct using both aspects. Thefore, fear of 
emotion was assessed with one item focusing on the fear of losing con-
trol of one’s emotions [17]: “I feel overwhelmed with my emotions ”, and 
one item focusing on the accepting awareness of emotions [39]: “I 
accept the way I am feeling ”. The values of the second item were reco-
ded, so that a higher score meant more fear of emotion. The within- 
person ω was 0.540 (95 %CI 0.484, 0.595). The Spearman-Brown cor-
relation of the person-centered mean was 0.326. 
2.5.2.5. Acting with awareness. For acting with awareness, we selected 
two items from the Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale with a high 
factor loading [52]: “Over the last period I did tasks and errands auto-
matically, without being aware of what I was doing ” and “Over the last 
period I was living in the moment ”. The values of the first item were 
recoded, so that a higher score meant more acting with awareness. The 
within-person ω was 0.344 (95 %CI 0.263, 0.424). The Spearman-Brown 
correlation of the person-centered mean was 0.296. 
2.5.2.6. Body awareness. Body awareness was assessed with two items, 
taken from the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Aware -
ness [24]. The first item reflected noticing of inner sensations: “Over the last period I was aware of things that were happening in my body, for 
example tension, emotional responses or other sensations ”. The second 
focused on embodiment: “Over the last period I felt at home in my 
body ”. The within-person ω was 0.062 (95 %CI  0.051, 0.174). The 
Spearman-Brown correlation of the person-centered mean was 0.127. 
2.5.3. Treatment as usual 
Because this was an open trial, we collected information from the 
participants ’ medical files to assess any (1) change in diagnosis, or (2) 
change in treatment or medication during the trial. 
2.6. Data analysis 
For our first hypothesis, mean-level change in affect and the affect 
regulation processes was assessed from pre-to-post intervention with 
interrupted time series analysis using Autoregressive Moving Average 
(ARMA) models, as these allow to account for serial dependency and 
non-stationarity [53]. While interrupted time series analysis is often 
used for assessing mean-level and gradual change (slope) effects, we 
expected any slope effects to occur during the intervention period, when 
diaries were not administered. Therefore, we focused on mean-level 
changes. For our second hypothesis, to study the temporal associations 
between stress and affect regulation processes, and these processes and 
affect, we conducted vector autoregressive modeling (VAR), using Sta-
taCorp STATA, version 14.0. A VAR model consists of a set of regression 
equations for two or more variables, where each of the endogenous 
variables is both regressed on its own lagged values (autocorrelation), 
and on the lagged values of other variables (cross-correlation) [54]. This 
allows studying the dynamic effect of each variable on the other vari-
ables, while correcting for any autocorrelation [54]. For each individual, 
separate VAR models were constructed for each affect regulation process 
(i.e., a VAR model with stress, one affect regulation process, and affect), 
both pre-intervention and post-intervention. Changes from pre-to-post 
intervention were examined for temporal (lagged) as well as the 
contemporaneous associations. For an elaborate explanation of the 
construction of the ARMA and VAR models, please see Electronic Sup-
plementary Material 1.

5through the study. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the 
participants. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were considered 
moderately severe, symptoms of stress were considered mild [40]. 
3.2. Treatment as usual, intervention evaluation and practice 
For most participants there were no changes in diagnosis, treatment 
or medication during the trial. For one participant the diagnosis was 
changed from social anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder to 
post-traumatic stress disorder. Three participants experienced a change 
in medication. None of the participants started a new treatment or dis-
continued treatment. 
Eleven participants completed the post-intervention evaluation. 
Participants rated the total quality of the mindful yoga intervention as 
9.2 (SD 0.41; range 9–10) and the quality of the teacher as 8.5 (SD 
0.69; range 8–10). Regarding the first aspect of mindfulness, enhanced 
awareness, most participants agreed somewhat or completely that they 
were able to (1) notice bodily sensations (somewhat : n 7; completely : n 
3; neutral : n 1), (2) feelings (somewhat : n 5; completely : n 2; 
neutral : n 3; somewhat disagree : n 1), and (3) thoughts and behavioral 
tendencies (somewhat : n 7; completely : n 3; completely disagree : n 
1). Regarding the second aspect of mindfulness, an accepting, 
nonjudgmental attitude, participants mostly agreed somewhat or 
completely or felt neutral about accepting themselves (somewhat : n 4; 
completely : n 2; neutral : n 3; somewhat disagree : n 2), their inner 
experiences (somewhat : n 7; neutral : n 2; somewhat disagree : n 2), 
and their ability to maintain a nonjudgemental attitude in the here and 
now (somewhat : n 8; neutral : n 2; completely disagree : n 1). 
Mean level of completed sessions of the 9-week mindful yoga inter-
vention was 7.8 (SD 0.83, range 6–9). Self-reported level of home 
practice was generally low (and lower than the recommended amount 
45 min per day): 4 participants practiced 15–30 min per day and 7 
participants practiced less than 15 min per day (one participant did not 
complete the post-evaluation assessment). 
3.3. Pre-post intervention change in affect balance, repetitive negative 
thinking, fear of emotion, acting with awareness, and body awareness 
(H1a and H1b) 
Table 2 shows the estimates and level of significance for the com-
parison of the individual means based on the time series from pre-to-post 
intervention. In six participants, there was a significant increase in affect 
balance. In four participants, stress decreased significantly. Repetitive 
negative thinking decreased in six participants, and fear of emotion in 
eight participants. Acting with awareness increased in seven partici -
pants, and body awareness in seven participants. In one individual there was significantly less body awareness post-intervention. 
3.4. Pre-post intervention change in associations between daily life stress 
and repetitive negative thinking, fear of emotion, acting with awareness, 
and body awareness (H2) 
Fig. 1 (right) shows the expected changes after the mindful yoga 
intervention. We expected that, in case of a stressful event, repetitive 
negative thinking and fear of emotion would have decreased after the 
mindful yoga intervention, and acting with awareness and body 
awareness would have increased, leading to better affect balance. 
Figs. 2a-d show the actual changes in standardized effect sizes for 
temporal (top) and contemporaneous (bottom) relationships for each of 
the pathways. Each bar represents the change in strength of the re-
lationships between stress and that variable (left) or between that var-
iable and affect balance (right) before and after the mindful yoga 
intervention for one individual. On the x-axis are the individual par-
ticipants, ordered with descending standardized effects sizes in the ex-
pected direction. On the y-axis the strength of the relationship is shown, 
using the standardized difference score of pre-to-post difference in the 
relationships (see Electronic Supplementary Material 1). Table 3 shows 
an overview of the changes in each examined relationship for each in-
dividual. All individuals showed a change in one of the pathways. 
However, none of the individuals showed changes in all of the pathways. 
Next, we describe the changes for each pathway. 
1.4.1. Repetitive negative thinking 
Fig. 2a shows the changes for the pathway from stress to affect bal-
ance through repetitive negative thinking. 
1.4.1.1. Temporal associations. For the stress-repetitive negative 
thinking temporal (lagged) association, in four individuals change was 
found in the expected direction, i.e., less repetitive negative thinking 
after stress (range:  0.44 ––0.13), and in two individuals in the opposite 
direction (range: 0.16 –1.68). At group level, average change was 0.075 
(SD 0.53, p .64). For the repetitive negative thinking-affect balance 
association, there was no change found in the expected direction, but in 
six individuals change was found in the opposite direction, i.e., lower 
affect balance after repetitive negative thinking (range:  0.13 to 
 0.28). At group level, average change was  0.105 (SD 0.12, p 
.012). 
1.4.1.2. Contemporaneous associations. For the contemporaneous stress- 
repetitive negative thinking association, in three individuals change was 
found in the expected direction, i.e., less repetitive negative thinking 
during stress (range:  0.11 to  0.38), and in six individuals in the

9found positive changes in the proposed affect regulation processes; fear 
of emotion showed changes from pre-to-post intervention for most in-
dividuals, followed by acting with awareness, body awareness, and then 
repetitive negative thinking (H1b). These results are in line with studies 
assessing change before and after a yoga or mindfulness intervention of 
comparable length on group level, with regard to positive changes in 
mood [13], rumination [27,55], avoidance and suppression [28], acting 
with awareness [29], and body awareness [30]. 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine within-person 
processes of change before and after a mindful yoga intervention. For 
mindfulness interventions, we found several studies that used ESM to 
assess changes, but they mostly assessed change on a group level. For 
instance, two studies found an increase in positive emotions after a 
mindfulness training [56,57] and one study a decrease in negative affect 
during the training [58]. One study using ESM to assess change during a 
mindfulness training within six individuals (with varying psychiatric 
disorders) found positive changes in symptoms of depression in half of 
the participants [59]. In that study, also in line with our results, half of 
the participants showed fewer rumination and more mindfulness. 
Considering the dynamic relationships between stress, the four 
proposed affect regulation processes and affect balance, we found in-
dividual differences in which pathways changed and how they changed 
(H2). Finding individual differences in the relationships between our 
proposed processes is in line with other studies assessing dynamic re-
lationships after a mindfulness intervention. For example, in a study 
assessing change during a mindfulness intervention with ESM, it was 
found that the strength of the relationship between mindfulness and 
affect differed substantially among participants [60]. The individual 
differences found in our study emphasize the importance of studying 
psychological processes at the level of the individual. These would be 
obscured in group level studies. It is also important to note that the 
mindful yoga intervention had many different ingredients (i.e., yoga 
postures, breathing practices, meditation) that all might have had 
different effects [34,61]. Therefore, it might be the case that not all 
ingredients work for each individual, or that the different ingredients 
work differently for different individuals. 
In our study, the strongest positive changes (i.e., improvement in the 
expected direction) were found for acting with awareness, followed by 
fear of emotion, both in the pathway from stress to the affect regulation 
process, and in the pathway from the affect regulation process to affect 
balance. For repetitive negative thinking and body awareness, there 
were several individuals with positive changes in the stress-pathway but 
not in the affect balance-pathway. There were also several individuals 
with unexpected changes in the stress-pathway for repetitive negative 
thinking, fear of emotion and body awareness, especially for the 
contemporaneous associations. In the affect balance-pathway there 
were several individuals with unexpected changes for repetitive nega-
tive thinking, fear of emotion, acting with awareness, and body 
awareness, both for temporal as well as contemporaneous associations. 
From the above, it can be concluded that, when considering the 
context of daily life stress, it seems difficult for some individuals to 
preserve a better affect balance with regards to the proposed processes. 
This is in line with another study using ESM to assess mindfulness skills 
in daily life; it was found that individuals have more difficulty with 
mindfulness skills when they are busy, but tend to be more mindful 
when they feel good [62]. Another study using a stress induction task 
found participants to report better affect balance after a brief mindful -
ness intervention, compared to a control intervention of being in silence, 
but found no difference in intrusive thoughts about the stressful event 
24 h later [63]. Still, given that many individuals did improve in mean 
levels of affect balance and affect regulation processes, they may have 
experienced more moments of recovery in between stressful events, 
possibly increasing chances of recovering from stress after a mindful 
yoga intervention. 
The unexpected changes for repetitive negative thinking, fear of 
emotion and body awareness (both in the stress-pathway and in the affect balance-pathway) and for acting with awareness (in the affect 
balance-pathway) may be in part related to our choice of items; they 
often reflected a form of awareness of one’s experiences (i.e., noticing 
negative thoughts and worries for repetitive negative thinking, noticing 
being overwhelmed with emotion for fear of emotion, noticing auto-
matic pilot behavior for acting with awareness and noticing bodily 
sensations or a feeling of being ‘at home’ in the body). We only included 
one item to assess acceptance (i.e., the acceptance of feelings for fear of 
emotion). While awareness is one aspect of skills that might improve 
after a mindfulness intervention, acceptance is another important 
aspect, and both may be necessary to improve affect [39]. Directly after 
the mindful yoga intervention, when the post-intervention ESM assess -
ment was done, individuals might have become more aware of certain 
types of thoughts or sensations, without already having developed a 
more accepting attitude towards these thoughts or sensations. There 
indeed is some evidence that suggests that skills to monitor attention 
begin to improve more directly after practice, while acceptance may 
take longer to acquire [64]. With the items in our current study, we 
cannot draw many conclusions about the acceptance skills. Hence, 
future studies should examine changes in acceptance next to awareness 
processes and use a longer follow-up period. 
4.1. Strengths and limitations 
By using daily assessments before and after a mindful yoga inter-
vention, we were able to carefully consider change in dynamic re-
lationships over time. Also, we have been able to present individual 
differences in changes for patients with chronic mood and anxiety dis-
orders, a group in which it is important to consider individual pathways 
of change; due to the chronic nature of the disorder, it is to be expected 
that not all individuals will experience changes. However, given that we 
used a small sample, we cannot conclude that these findings generalize 
to the population of patients with chronic mood and anxiety disorders at 
large. Another limitation is that we assessed temporal associations 
lasting up to one day, while slower effects might have occurred as well. 
For example, another study assessing changes within individuals found a 
change in rumination or mindfulness result in a change in affect balance 
up to two days later [59]. Furthermore, it could be that the post- 
intervention sampling period was too soon after the intervention to 
observe a change in stress reactivity and affect balance. Other studies 
investigating change after a yoga intervention have found that imme -
diately after the intervention no change is apparent, but at a 6- or 12- 
month follow-up a change is found [65,66]. In addition to this, as 
mentioned in the previous section, our lack of measurement of accep -
tance skills might limit our conclusions for these processes that are also 
important in (longer-term) changes after a mindfulness-based inter-
vention [64]. Considering the low within-person internal consistency for 
some of the assessed processes, we might have captured aspects of these 
processes that are quite independent from each other, especially for 
acting with awareness and body awareness. We based the two state-
ments for body awareness on theory, and took them from a validated 
questionnaire used for between-person (group-level) studies, that is 
important in assessing body awareness. However, the low internal 
consistency of the two items raises questions regarding the validity of 
the construct of body awareness at the within-person level. Still, all the 
assessed items represent equally important components of the processes 
under study, therefore, we decided to keep them together as planned. In 
addition, the methods we used may have been suboptimal for assessing 
the internal consistency for two-item constructs. Nevertheless, using 
simple correlations did not change our results. Another limitation could 
be that some studies show that the use of frequent assessments in daily 
life might make participants more aware of the variables under study, 
thereby changing the natural environment [67–69]. However, evidence 
of this is mixed [70–73]. To limit potential enhanced awareness as an 
influencing factor, we used a design with an assessment period before 
and after the intervention. If enhanced awareness was present, this N.K. Vollbehr et al.

10would have already happened before the intervention, so we would 
expect any changes in the variables under study after the intervention to 
be attributed to the intervention and not to enhanced awareness. 
Another limitation is that our study period took from January to April, 
seasons moving from Winter (with darker days) to Spring (with more 
daylight). We therefore cannot rule out the possibility that the timing of 
the study might be a factor contributing to the changes. Next, given that 
this was a study in a naturalistic setting and some individuals experi -
enced a change in their medication, we cannot rule out that this might 
also have had an effect on the outcomes for these individuals. Finally, 
none of the participants completed the recommended amount of home 
practice during the training. As research shows a small but significant 
relationship between level of practice and study outcomes [74], it could 
have been possible that participants did not optimally benefit from the 
training. 
4.2. Conclusions 
We must concede that the study design does not allow us to attribute 
the observed results to the specific effect of yoga training, as weekly 
yoga sessions may not be intensive enough to help patients with 
(chronic) mood and anxiety disorders, and non-specific effects such as 
the Hawthorne effect could explain the observed benefits due to the lack 
of a control group. However, with this study, we suggest that a 9-week 
mindful yoga intervention may provide benefits to some individuals 
with chronic mood or anxiety disorders in terms of an overall better 
affect balance, less repetitive negative thinking and fear of emotion and 
more acting with awareness and body awareness after the intervention. 
Nevertheless, changing these affect regulation processes under stressful 
conditions, seems difficult for most individuals. Further research should 
focus on the actual application of new skills in daily life to help in-
dividuals with chronic mood and anxiety disorders further benefit from 
mindful yoga interventions and be able to integrate these skills into their 
daily lives. Larger samples with a long-term follow-up, that uses items 
that capture both the awareness aspect of the processes as well as the 
accepting attitude aspect are recommended. This could shed light on the 
generalizability of the effects and on the nature of the individual dif-
ferences that were found.
