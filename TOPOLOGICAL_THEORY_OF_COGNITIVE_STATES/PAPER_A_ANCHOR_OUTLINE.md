# Paper A Outline: Topological Theory of Cognitive States

## Title Options

1. *Topological Regimes in Dynamic Cognitive Networks: A Spectral Approach*
2. *The Geometry of Attention: Information Saturation and Network Topology*
3. **Selected:** *Topological Theory of Cognitive States: Spectral Signatures of Information Processing Regimes*

## Target Audience

Neuroscientists, Network Physicists, Complex Systems Researchers.
**Tone:** Dry, mathematical, descriptive. NO metaphors. NO "consciousness" claims beyond operational definitions.

## Abstract

* Propose a framework where cognitive states are defined as topological regimes of a dynamic network.
* Introduce the Saturation Postulate ($I \le C_{max}$).
* Demonstrate how spectral properties (Laplacian eigenvalues) correlate with processing modes (Integration vs. Segregation).
* Avoid psychological labels; use topological classes (e.g., "High-Modularity Regime" instead of "Dissociation").

## 1. Introduction

* **Problem:** Lack of formal physical definitions for "mental states". Current definitions are semantic/behavioral.
* **Proposal:** Define states via Graph Theory and Information Theory.
* **Hypothesis:** Phenomenology follows Topology.

## 2. Formal Framework (The "Physics")

* **2.1 Ontological Primitives:** Node, Edge, State (briefly, ref. Foundation).
* **2.2 The Saturation Constraint:** Derivation of the Bottleneck necessity from Shannon capacity limits.
  * $I_{flow} \le C_{max} \implies$ Selection (Attention).

## 3. Topological Regimes (The "States")

* **3.1 The Healthy Regime (Criticality):**
  * Balance between Integration (Small-World) and Segregation (Modularity).
  * Signature: Power-law degree distribution, $1/f$ noise.
* **3.2 The Trapped Regime (Pathological Order):**
  * High clustering coefficient, low path length within clusters, low global efficiency.
  * Analogy: Overfitting / Anxiety.
  * Spectral Signature: Deep attractors, low entropy.
* **3.3 The Fragmented Regime (Pathological Disorder):**
  * Extreme modularity, disconnected components $(\lambda_2 \to 0)$.
  * Analogy: Underfitting / Dissociation.

## 4. Spectral Analysis (The "Measurement")

* **4.1 The Laplacian Spectrum:** Explain $\lambda_2$ (Fiedler value) as algebraic connectivity.
* **4.2 Eigenvalues as Timescales:**
  * Small $\lambda$: Slow, global modes.
  * Large $\lambda$: Fast, local modes.
* **4.3 Mapping to Neural Oscillations:** Formal correspondence between graph spectra and EEG bands (without claiming biological realism, just isomorphism).

## 5. Discussion

* advantages of a topological nomenclature over a symptomatological one.
* Predictions: How topology predicts system robustness and failure modes.
* Limitations: It is a coarse-grained model.

## 6. Mathematical Appendix

* Definitions of $Q$ (Modularity), $E_{glob}$ (Efficiency), $S_{VN}$ (Von Neumann Entropy).
