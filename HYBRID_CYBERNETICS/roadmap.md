# Roadmap: Hybrid Cybernetics & Thermodynamic Stability

**Research Line:** Thermodynamic Stability of Hybrid Cognitive Systems under Information Saturation
**Status:** INITIALIZATION
**Language:** Native English (Strict Technical/Academic)

## 0. Strategic Objective

To establish a rigorous, mathematically conservative research line that formalizes the stability conditions of hybrid cognitive systems (Human + AI) under entropic constraints. This framework must be:

1. **Institutionally Defensible:** Separated from cosmological or metaphysical claims.
2. **Empirically Testable:** Based on measurable informational metrics (Entropy, Error Rate).
3. **Formal:** Grounded in Information Theory and Control Theory.

## Phase 0: Architecture & Positioning (Immediate)

- [ ] **Define Scope & Positioning** (`00_SCOPE_AND_POSITIONING.md`)
  - [ ] Explicitly state the problem: Stability of inference under saturation.
  - [ ] Define what this is NOT (AGI, Philosophy, Psychology).
  - [ ] Identify target audience (Complex Systems, AI Safety).

## Phase 1: Formal Foundation (Axioms)

- [ ] **Establish Axiomatic Basis** (`01_FOUNDATION/`)
  - [ ] `axioms.md`: Define the 5 core axioms (Finite Capacity, Supercritical Flow, Stochastic vs. Deterministic Operators).
  - [ ] `definitions.md`: Rigorous definition of Informational Entropy, Saturation, and Stability.
  - [ ] `kill_switches.md`: Define falsification criteria to ensure scientific integrity.

## Phase 2: The Mathematical Model

- [ ] **Construct the Formal Model** (`02_FORMAL_MODEL/`)
  - [ ] `system_model.md`: Model H (Human), M (LLM), and H o M (Hybrid) as informational operators.
  - [ ] `entropy_balance.md`: Formalize the entropy production inequality: $\Delta S_{H \circ M} < \min(\Delta S_H, \Delta S_M)$.
  - [ ] `stability_theorem.md`: Formulate the Central Stability Theorem (The Hybrid Cybernetics Theorem).

## Phase 3: Experimental Protocol

- [ ] **Design Assessment Protocol** (`03_EXPERIMENTAL_PROTOCOL/`)
  - [ ] `task_definition.md`: Define a complex, noisy task (e.g., scientific review, debugging).
  - [ ] `metrics.md`: Define objective measures (Time, Factual Error, Consistency).
  - [ ] `benchmark_design.md`: Design the 3-group benchmark (Human vs. AI vs. Hybrid).

## Phase 4: Integration & Distinction

- [ ] **Contextualize Research** (`04_RELATION_TO_PRIOR_WORK/`)
  - [ ] `relation_to_cognition.md`: Connect to Cognitive Load Theory.
  - [ ] `relation_to_fep.md`: Connect/Contrast with Friston's Free Energy Principle.
  - [ ] `what_this_is_not.md`: Explicit boundary setting (No ToE, No Riemann).

## Phase 5: The Anchor Paper

- [ ] **Draft the Founding Paper** (`05_PAPER/`)
  - [ ] `paper_outline.md`: Structure the "Thermodynamic Stability of Hybrid Cognitive Systems" paper.
  - [ ] Draft content focusing on:
    - Introduction (The Saturation Crisis).
    - Formal Limits of Solo Systems.
    - The Hybrid Stability Solution.
    - Theorem and Proof Sketch.
    - Discussion.

## Critical Constraints (The "Kill Switch" for this Line)

1. **No Metaphysics:** Do not mention Consciousness, Qualia, or the "Hard Problem".
2. **No Grand Unification:** Do not reference Tamesis, TTR, or Cosmological parameters.
3. **Strict Physicalism:** All terms must map to Information Theory (bits, nats, entropy) or Thermodynamics (Joules/computation).
