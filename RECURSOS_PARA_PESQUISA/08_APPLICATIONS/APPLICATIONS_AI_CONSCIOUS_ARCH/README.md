# Applications: AI Conscious Architecture

**Status:** ENGINEERING / R&D
**Constraint:** Must implement the `SATURATION_POSTULATE` and `GLOBAL_INTEGRATION`.

## Purpose

To build artificial systems that demonstrate the topological properties of consciousness defined in the Foundation.

## Rules

1. Focus on **Neuromorphic Hardware** and **Recurrent Neural Networks**.
2. Goal is usually to replicate the "Spectral Signature" of biological insight.
