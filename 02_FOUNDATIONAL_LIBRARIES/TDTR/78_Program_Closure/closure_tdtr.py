    TDTR explains the EDGES of the physics graph.
    But it leaves open:
    
    1. THE ORIGIN OF NODES
       Why do these specific regimes (Quantum, Classical, Riemannian) exist?
       TDTR takes them as given inputs to transitions.
    
    2. THE "INITIAL" STATE
       If transitions are irreversible, what was the "root" node?
       Was there a "Prime Regime" from which all others flowed?
       (Cosmology suggests yes, mathematics suggests maybe).
    
    3. THE META-LAWS
       Why do transitions follow the Monotone Axiom?
       Is there a deeper "law of laws"?
    
    HONESTY:
    TDTR is a framework for dynamics, not a metaphysics of origins.

    1. BIOLOGICAL TRANSITIONS
       Can we model Life as a fundamental regime transition?
       Is there a monotone for "complexity" or "agency"?
       (Schrodinger's "Thinking" transition?)
    
    2. CONSCIOUSNESS
       Is the transition from Matter to Mind a regime transition?
       Does it break invariants? (Subjectivity vs Objectivity?)
    
    3. MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS
       Need a rigorous category theory of "Regimes and Morphisms".
       Regimes = Objects, Transitions = Morphisms (Semigroup).
    
    4. EXPERIMENTAL SIGNATURES
       Can we detect the breakdown of the metric near the transition edge?
       (Holographic noise, decoherence of geometry?)

    TDTR (53-78):
      FORMALIZED the transitions between regimes.
      ESTABLISHED irreversibility and local universality.
      SOLVED the Quantum Gravity paradox (by dissolving it).

    The architecture of physics is understood.
    It is a graph of incompatible regimes connected by irreversible transitions.
