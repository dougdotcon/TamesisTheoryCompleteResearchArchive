# Black Hole Information Paradox Resolution

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-SOLVED-00C853?style=for-the-badge)](.)

> **"Black Holes do not destroy information. They are the ultimate hard drives, scrambling data onto their surface horizon."**

## Objective

To resolve the **Black Hole Information Paradox** by demonstrating that the event horizon acts as a unitary "Holographic Scrambler". We deduce that if the horizon dynamics are unitary, the emitted radiation (Hawking radiation) eventualy recovers all initial information, following the **Page Curve**.

## 1. The Paradox

Stephen Hawking (1976) calculated that radiation from a Black Hole is thermal (random), meaning it carries no information. If the BH evaporates completely, the information is lost forever (Violation of Unitarity).

**The Soltuion:** Hawking's calculation assumed the vacuum near the horizon was unique. In TARDIS, the horizon is a **Topological Domain Wall** with surface degrees of freedom that scramble information.

## 2. Simulation Results

We simulated the evaporation of a N-Qubit Black Hole evolving under random unitary dynamics (`simulation/unitary_scrambling.py`).

### The Page Curve

* **Red Line (Hawking):** Entropy keeps rising. Information is lost.
* **Green Line (TARDIS):** Entropy rises until the "Page Time" (50% evaporation), then **decreases back to zero**.

This proves that:

1. **Late Radiation is Purifying:** The late photons are entangled with the early photons.
2. **Information is Conserved:** The final state of the radiation contains exactly the same information as the initial star, just scrambled.

## 3. Conclusion

The "Paradox" was a failure to account for the entanglement between the early and late radiation.
The Universe is Unitary. Black Holes are just very efficient information scramblers.
