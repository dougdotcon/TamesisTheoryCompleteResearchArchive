* **Description (Abstract):**
    > We present a unified model of the universe as a distributed computational system operating on a discrete informational graph, termed the "Tamesis Kernel". We demonstrate that the smooth manifold of General Relativity is not fundamental but an emergent statistical property of the graph in the thermodynamic limit. We explicitly derive the Einstein Field Equations with an entropic correction term and map the Standard Model to topological defects in the graph connectivity. Using Fermi-LAT data (GRB 090510) and IXPE polarimetry (4U 0142+61), we establish strict empirical bounds on the Tamesis coupling. Furthermore, we demonstrate a first-principles derivation of the LHC total cross-section ($\sigma_{tot} \approx 110 \text{ mb}$ at 13 TeV), marking the first time a graph-theoretic model aligns quantitatively with high-energy particle physics data. These results transition Tamesis to a state of non-falsification, providing a quantitative roadmap for next-generation space-based observatories.

    > **Executive Summary:**
    > **Tamesis** reconfigures physics as a computational process. We demonstrate that Spacetime ($g_{\mu\nu}$), Matter ($\pi_n$), and Gravity ($T_{\mu\nu}^{(info)}$) are emergent statistical properties of a discrete informational graph (The Kernel) minimizing its processing cost. Unlike geometric unifications, Tamesis is built on *falsifiability*, predicting observable spectral lags in Gamma-Ray Bursts ($\Delta t \sim 10^{-15}s$) and vacuum birefringence, bridging the gap between Quantum Information and General Relativity.
