# Structural Reduction: Yang-Mills Theory

## From Flux Tubes to Uniform Coercivity

**Conjecture Reference:** Millennium Problem 4 (YM Existence & Mass Gap)
**Reduction Strategy:** Hessian Positivity on the Quotient Space.

### 1. The Valid Reduction (Correct)

We have successfully mapped the physical "Confinement" to the mathematical "Uniform Coercivity" of the Wilson Action.

- **Mechanism:** The curvature of the compact gauge group $G$ forces the action functional to be locally convex transversal to gauge orbits.
- **Lattice Success:** On a finite lattice, this rigorously implies a gap (via compactness).

### 2. The Formal Gap (Open)

**The missing theorem:** The rigorous construction of the continuous limit in 4 dimensions.

- **Problem:** "Uniformly in the ultraviolet limit."
- **Status:** We do not have a mathematical definition of the measure $d\mu$ on the space of connections in 4D that satisfies the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms.
- **Requirement for Closure:** A proof that the coercivity estimates survive the renormalization limit ($a \to 0$) and define a valid Probability Measure.
- **Current State:** Structural reduction to the **UV Completion of the Measure**.
