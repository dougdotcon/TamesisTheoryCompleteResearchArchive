# Axiomatic Dependency Graph

## Purpose

To map the logical structure of the *Topological Theory of Cognitive States* and identify "Load-Bearing Pillars" vs. "Derivative Claims". This allows us to defend the core without dying on the hill of peripheral hypotheses.

---

## 1. The Core (Tier 0: Non-Negotiable)

These axioms correspond to the **Foundation (Chapters 1-2)**. If these fall, the theory collapses.

* **[A0] Physicalism of Information**: Information is a physical quantity ($I = H_{max} - H_{obs}$) coupled to energy/entropy.
* **[A1] Relational Ontology**: The primitive is the *relation* (edge), not the node. State is topological configuration.
* **[A2] Saturation Limit**: All physical channels have finite capacity $C_{max}$.
  * $\implies$ **Bottleneck Theorem**: Any system with $I_{in} > C_{max}$ *must* exhibit filtering (Attention).

---

## 2. The Model (Tier 1: Structural Inferences)

These correspond to **Topology & Spectrum (Chapters 3-4)**. These are the mathematical models derived from Tier 0.

* **[A3] Topological Identity**: Phenomenological states are isomorphic to Topological Regimes.
  * *Dependency:* Requires [A1].
  * *Falsification:* Finding a state change without topological change.
* **[A4] Spectral Phenomonology**: Qualia is the spectral distribution of the network Laplacian.
  * *Dependency:* Requires [A3].
  * *Note:* This is a strong claim. If standard IIT is true (static integration), this might need adjustment, but [A3] survives.

---

## 3. The Applications (Tier 2: Derivative Hypotheses)

These correspond to **Consciousness & Holography (Chapters 5-6)**, plus the **Cognitive Biotypes**.

* **[H1] Holographic Perception**: Perception is dimensional reduction.
  * *Status:* High confidence, but theory survives if this is replaced by another coding scheme.
* **[H2] Global Integration (Consciousness)**: Consciousness = Global availability.
  * *Status:* Standard workspace model rephrased. Robust.
* **[H3] The Biotypes (Trap, Chaos, Viscosity)**:
  * *Dependency:* Relies on [A3] (Topology determines state).
  * *Defense:* Practical utility. Even if imperfect, if it stratifies patients better than DSM-5, it stands.

## 4. Failure Modes Analysis

### Scenario A: "The Brain is not a Graph" (Field Theory Attack)

* **Attack**: Neural fields are continuous, not discrete nodes.
* **Defense**: Discretization is an approximation. The Spectral Graph Theory generalizes to **Spectral Geometry (Manifolds)**. The *Math* ([A4]) survives on manifolds even if nodes ([A1]) become continuous volume elements.

### Scenario B: "Information cost is negligible"

* **Attack**: Brain computing is reversible/adiabatic.
* **Defense**: Biology refutes this. Brain is 20W. [A2] (Saturation) is safe due to thermodynamics.

### Scenario C: "Qualia is non-physical" (Dualism)

* **Attack**: Hard Problem is unsolvable by physics.
* **Defense**: We reject the premise. We solve the *Structural Problem*. We define consciousness operationally. If dualism is true, *all* science fails, not just this theory.

---

## 5. Defense Strategy

**Do not defend [H3] (Biotypes) with the same ferocity as [A0] (Physical Information).**

* If someone attacks the clinical model, retreat to the Topology ([A3]).
* If someone attacks the Topology, retreat to the Physics ([A0]).
* **Stand your ground at [A0].** It is thermodynamic law.
