# PAPER 3: THERMODYNAMIC SELECTION IN MATHEMATICAL UNDECIDABILITY

## Resolving Universal Classes via Physical Stability

> **Abstract:** In Class B (Universal) problems, internal geometric constraints are insufficient to force a unique solution (The Density Obstruction). We propose that the resolution of such problems requires a perspective shift from **Internal Deduction** to **External Selection**. We demonstrate that **Thermodynamic Stability** (Entropy Maximization) acts as a rigorous selection principle, identifying the "physically realizable" configuration from the infinite sea of mathematical possibilities.

## 1. The Necessity of Selection

We have established:

1. **Paper 1:** Class B problems (Riemann, P vs NP) are structurally distinct from Class A (Poincaré).
2. **Paper 2:** Class A methods (Exclusion) face structural barriers in Class B.

**The Dilemma:** If geometry cannot close the problem, is it undecidable?
**The Resolution:** It is logically undecidable via internal geometry but **Realizability Constrained**.

### Definition 1.1 (Structural Selection)

A selection principle $\mathcal{S}$ is a functional on the solution space $\Omega$ that assigns a "Stability Cost" to each configuration. The "Physical Solution" is the configuration that minimizes this cost globally (Phase Stability).

## 2. Entropy as the Selector

The only selection principle consistent with information theory and causality is **Spectral Entropy**.

### Principle 1 (The Maximum Entropy Selection)

In a universal solution space $\Omega$ governed by a chaotic operator $H$, the configuration that maximizes the Spectral Entropy $S[\rho]$ is the **GUE Distribution**.

* **Implication:** The "Critical Line" in Riemann's case is the state of Maximum Entropy. Any deviation reduces entropy and is thermodynamically suppressed in realizable systems.

## 3. Resolving the Millenium Problems

This framework reinterprets the classical conjectures:

### 3.1 P vs NP (The Censorship Resolution)

* **Class:** B (Universal Spin Glass).
* **Condition:** If the computer is physically realizable (Finite Energy/Time).
* **Selection:** Thermodynamics imposes a noise cost on shortcuts.
* **Result:** P $\neq$ NP holds for physically realizable computers.

### 3.2 Riemann Hypothesis (The Stability Resolution)

* **Class:** B (Universal Chaos).
* **Condition:** If the Zeta operator is physically realizable (Class $C_{crit}$).
* **Selection:** The GUE configuration (Critical Line) is the only local maximum of spectral entropy.
* **Result:** RH is the only stable configuration for realizable operators.

## 4. The End of "Pure" Mathematics?

This does not mean mathematics ends. It means **Foundational Mathematics** under physical constraints accepts a new constraint:
> **The Realizability Constraint:** Among all logically consistent models, only those maximizing information capacity (Entropy) are physically stable.

This bridges the gap between Platonism (All exist) and Empiricism (Only stable ones persist).

## 5. Summary of the Theory

| | Class A (Rigid) | Class B (Universal) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Object** | Manifolds, Groups | Complex Systems, Spectra |
| **Barrier** | None (Trivial) | Density Obstruction |
| **Resolution** | Geometric Exclusion | Thermodynamic Selection |
| **Outcome** | Unique Theorem | Stable Phase |

The Theory of Structural Solvability is thus complete: it defines *which tools to use* for *which problems*.
