Women ABSTRACT  
Background: The role of testosterone in mood regulation has been studied by different authors with inconsistent 
results. It seems that low testosterone could be related to depressed mood in hypogonadal men; however, in 
women, both high and low testosterone levels have been implicated in depression. In this study, we evaluated 
androgen levels in depressed patients, comparing between sexes, and testing anxiety levels. 
Methods: We included unmedicated women and men diagnosed with major depressive disorder, according to 
DSM-5 criteria. Patients with drug and alcohol abuse, hormonal medication, uncontrolled medical illness, or 
psychiatric disorders other than depression or anxiety were excluded. We applied the HDRS, State and Trait 
Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to all participants and measured cortisol, total 
testosterone, free testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone. 
Results: A total of 71 participants (21 male) completed all evaluations. In the overall sample, we detected cor-
relations between cortisol levels and STAI scores, as well as between perceived stress and cortisol. In our cor-
relation analysis of testosterone and psychological evaluations stratified by sex, we found that in women, higher 
levels of free testosterone were associated with increased perceived stress, as indicated by the PSS. 
Limitations: A small sample was recruited for the study. Furthermore, although validated anxiety scales were 
used, all data were self-reported. 
Conclusions: The role of testosterone in anxiety differs between male and female depressed patients. Perceived 
stress could be an important measurement in women, as it was related to FT levels in this sample.   
Introduction 
A complex relationship between testosterone and affective symp -
toms has been observed by several authors, with both increased and 
decreased testosterone levels associated with depressive symptom -
atology. Variations in study methodologies or testosterone measurement 
methods may account for different results [42]. Additionally, sex in-
fluences the association between testosterone and mood. In men, 
consistently low testosterone levels have been linked to depressive 
symptoms [2,27,36] . Moreover, testosterone replacement therapy has 
demonstrated efficacy in alleviating depressive symptoms in this pop-
ulation [35,41] . The exploration of specific symptoms associated with 
extreme levels of testosterone in male patients showed sleep problems 
and tiredness in those with high testosterone (760 –1000 ng/dL or higher), while in participants with low testosterone (150 ng/dL or 
lower), problems with appetite were observed [22]. 
Studies investigating depressed mood in women reveal a more 
complex relationship between testosterone and depressive symptoms. In 
adolescents the higher testosterone levels resulted a predictor of 
depression during puberty [7]; and, it is believed that the elevation of 
testosterone increases the risk of suicidal behaviour in adolescents and 
young adults [34]. It is noteworthy that there is an increased prevalence 
of depression and anxiety among women with polycystic ovarian syn-
drome (PCOS), in which hyperandrogenism is an important component 
in the clinical presentation [33]; even though we cannot assert that 
increased testosterone is the cause of anxiety and depression in women 
with PCOS, we also cannot rule it out. Some authors suggest that the 
relation between depression and high levels of testosterone is presented

2only in women with severe depression [31]. On the other hand, the 
observation that low testosterone levels are associated with depression 
and certain anxiety disorders in women [15] did not confirm the hy-
pothesis that elevated androgens levels are responsible for depressive 
symptoms. Menopausal status is another factor that could influence the 
participation of androgens in mood. A meta-analysis reported a signifi -
cant association between serum total levels of testosterone and depres -
sion in premenopausal women, but not in postmenopausal women [24]. 
Conversely, a study conducted by Bromberger observed increased 
testosterone levels in depressed women after an 8-year follow-up [4], 
contradicting the finding that no relationship was found between uri-
nary testosterone levels and depressed mood in a ten-year longitudinal 
study [40]. 
Moreover, inconsistent results have been reported in studies of 
testosterone therapy in women. For instance, one study reported a sig-
nificant reduction in depressive scores after eight weeks of treatment in 
an open-label protocol using a low dose of transdermal testosterone for 
women with treatment resistant depression [28]. Conversely, a well- 
designed and clinical trial employing low-dose testosterone supple -
mentation failed to improve depressive symptoms in women with 
antidepressant-resistant depression [9]. 
Despite the need to refine new methodologies for researching the 
effects of androgens on depression [25], an imbalance of testosterone 
levels appears to play a role in the pathophysiology of depression in 
women. According to this notion, low androgen levels are associated 
with low self-esteem and depression; while high androgen levels could 
be related to conflicting behaviour and depression [32]. 
It is well known that a high percentage of patients suffering 
depression also have anxiety symptoms [17] (Gorman 1996). Depres -
sion, whether with or without anxiety, have the potential to alter 
both the mental state and biological parameters of patients [44](Zie 
X, 2023). However, studies examining the relationship between anxiety 
and testosterone levels in depressed patients are relatively scarce. In a 
cross-sectional study of adolescents, elevated testosterone levels were 
found to be associated with higher anxiety scores in depressed patients 
[5]. Paradoxically, a single dose of testosterone administration reduced 
fear potentiated startle in healthy women [20]. Furthermore, in a clin-
ical study, comparing testosterone to placebo in female volunteers, re-
searchers observed that a single dose of testosterone significantly 
reduced the unconscious emotional response to fear, but did not affect 
the self-reported measures of anxiety [38]. Since that sex hormones 
interact with the hypothalamic –pituitary –adrenal (HPA) axis, and that 
testosterone may reduce stress-elicited cortisol peaks [19], coupled with 
the observation that cortisol levels are often elevated in depressed pa-
tients, the association between cortisol and androgens in depressed 
women and men remains to be determined. 
On these bases, the present study aimed to assess the role of testos -
terone in depressive and anxiety symptoms, comparing between sexes, 
and employing a more extensive evaluation of the anxiety spectrum, 
using the Perceived Stress Scale and the State and Trait Anxiety 
Inventory. 
Methods 
Design and participants 
We conducted a cross-sectional assessment in order to evaluate the 
relationship between affective symptoms and hormones (cortisol, free 
testosterone, total testosterone, and adrenal androgen dehydroepian -
drosterone, DHEA), with a deep evaluation of anxiety. 
We invited depressed patients attending the outpatient ’s clinic at the 
National Institute of Psychiatry in M˘exico City to participate in this 
study. Participants were required to be between 18 to 65 years old, and 
to meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth 
Edition (DSM-5) Depression Criteria. Additionally, they had to be un-
medicated at the beginning of the study. An experimented Psychiatrist evaluated the participants in the first interview to verify the Depression 
diagnosis, and applied a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 
(HDRS-17). A minimum score of 18 points in the HDRS was necessary to 
participate in the present study. Patients with suspected manic or hy-
pomanic episodes, psychotic features, tobacco, alcohol or drugs abuse, 
and patients with psychiatric disorders other than anxiety disorders, 
were discarded. The diagnosis of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder 
was not allowed. Pregnant women or participants using any hormonal 
supplement were not included in the study, as well as patients with 
endocrinopathies or uncontrolled medical illnesses. All the methods 
were explained to the patients before the informed consent was signed. 
The Institutional ethical committee approved the present study (Register 
ID: CONBIOETICA-09-CEI-010 –20170316). 
Measures 
Socio-demographic variables 
We collected the following data: Education was documented as study 
years; marital status as a categorical variable including “living with a 
partner ”, “separated or divorced ”, and “never married ”; occupation was 
catalogued as “employed ”, “self-employed ”, “unemployed ”, “student ”, 
“homemaker ”, and “other ”. 
The socioeconomic level of participants was evaluated using the 
instrument created by the Mexican Association of Market Research and 
Public Opinion Agencies, called AMAI (Asociaci ˘on Mexicana de Agen -
cias de Inteligencia de Mercado). The questionnaire evaluates the level 
of satisfaction of the most important household needs, including internet 
services, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of auto-
mobiles and number of employed individuals in the household, among 
others. The AMAI classifies economic status in 7 levels as follows: A/B 
high, C upper-middle, C middle level, C- lower-middle, D low level, 
D poverty, and E extreme poverty. The AMAI is used frequently in 
Mexican studies as it represents the main characteristics of the popula -
tion and allows homogeneity of the levels assigned to the population [1]. 
Clinical characteristics: A complete clinical interview was conducted 
to evaluate the Depression diagnosis, and the absence of psychotic, 
manic or hypomanic history symptoms. We assessed tobacco, alcohol or 
drug use, as well as personal and familiar history of affective disorders. 
The menstrual phase was recorded in all female participants, based 
on the patient ’s report. Physical examination, including anthropo -
metric variables was conducted, and a haematological biochemical 
profile (including glucose, lipid profile and thyroid exam) was per-
formed in all participants. All information about medical history was 
registered. 
Clinimetrical assessments 
17-HDRS. The Hamilton depression rating scale is widely used to 
evaluate depressive symptoms intensity. It is a questionnaire adminis -
tered by the clinician, and it is composed of 17 items registered in a scale 
0 to 2 or 0 to 4; with a total score from 0 to 52. The higher scores indicate 
a more severe depression. Intensity of depressive symptoms is classified 
according to the cut-off scores as follows: 0–7 without depression; 8–13 
mild depression; 14 to 18 moderated depression, and a score equal or 
greater than 19 is considered severe depression [18]. Translation to 
Spanish and validation process has reported adequate clinimetric 
properties for its use in the Mexican adult population [30]. 
State and trait anxiety inventory (STAI). The STAI is a self-administered 
questionnaire which evaluates the presence and intensity of anxiety 
symptoms: It is composed of two different subscales: the Trait anxiety 
(TA) subscale and the State anxiety (SA) subscale. The SA includes 20 
items that evaluate the intensity of anxiety at the time of assessment, 
scored in a Likert type scale, where 0 corresponds to “Not at all” and 4 
means “Very much so”. In the case of TA, it examines the tendency to M. Flores-Ramos et al.

3suffer anxiety symptoms over time, with responses scored from 0 to 4 
according to the frequency of symptoms, that correspond from “Almost 
never ” to “Almost always ” [37]. 
Perceived stress scale (PSS). The PSS is a self-administered questionnaire 
which evaluates the perception of different stressors by the patient. The 
instrument evaluates the degree to which live circumstances are 
perceived as uncontrollable, overwhelming, and difficult to manage [3]. 
It is composed of 10 items which explore how often the patient feels 
some experiences, and are rated from 0 to 4. Some items are reversed, 
and the total score indicates the grade of stress perceived, being higher 
scores related to higher stress perception [6]. The cultural adaptation for 
its use in Mexican samples showed an adequate internal consistency (α 
0.83) and confirmed the factorial structure [16]. 
Laboratory tests: All samples were taken in a fasting state, from 7 to 9 
in the morning. An experienced laboratory technician collected 6.0 mL 
of venous blood in a sterile Vacutainer tube. The blood was centrifuged 
(4000 r.p.m. for 25 min at 4C) and the serum was stored at -20C in 1.5 
mL Eppendorf tubes. Total testosterone measurement (TT; Demeditec 
Diagnostics GmbH, Kiel, Germany; Cat. DE4386) was done with direct 
radioimmunoassay, with an analytic sensitivity of 0.025 ng/mL. Free 
testosterone (FT) was quantified with the solid phase enzyme-linked 
immune-assay using commercial kits (Demeditec Diagnostics GmbH, 
Kiel Germany), the quantification range was 0.2–100 pg/mL, with an 
analytical sensitivity of 0.04 pg/mL. DHEA was measured by enzyme- 
linked immunosorbent assay using a commercial kit (ENZO Life Sci-
ences, AI-900 –093, UK), with a high analytic sensitivity and D9 % of 
intra- and inter-assay variation. In all cases we followed the manufac -
turer ’s instructions. Cortisol (ADI-900 –093, ENZO Life Science, UK) 
was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a 
commercial kit. Analytical sensitivity was 56.72 pg/ml (range 
156–10,000 pg/ml). Samples were analysed by duplicate and a mean 
was calculated. 
Statistical analysis 
We conducted a descriptive analysis for the sociodemographic and 
clinical variables. Comparative analysis of clinimetric scores between 
men and women was done using t-test; bivariate correlation between 
hormonal measures and clinimetric scores was conducted using Pearson 
correlation test. Additionally, partial correlations were conducted 
in women, controlling for age, BMI, and menstrual phase. A linear 
regression analysis was done to assess the relationship between 
hormonal measurement, and clinimetric scores. A separated anal-
ysis was conducted for women and men, Statistical analyses were 
performed using SPSS software v.27.0. Significance was set at p < 
0.05. 
Results 
A total of 92 patients were initially included in the study; with 71 
participants completing all the evaluations. The final analysis comprised 
21 men and 50 women. Those who were excluded either did not undergo 
laboratory or provided inconsistent or incomplete information on the 
anxiety questionnaires. Clinical variables, anxiety, and depression 
scores are presented in Table 1. No differences were observed between 
sexes in terms of age, body mass index, or biochemical variables. The 
anxiety scores were consistently higher in women compared to men, 
although no statistical difference was observed in the PSS scores and the 
SA inventory. However, a significant difference was observed in trait 
anxiety, with women scoring higher than men. Depressive symptom 
scores were similar between men and women. 
Sociodemographic variables are presented in Table 2, no differences 
in the proportion of socioeconomic groups were observed, the middle 
level was the most frequently observed in our sample. Study years and marital status were distributed in a similar proportion between men and 
women. 
Regarding menstrual cycle phase, 32 patients were in the 
follicular phase, and 15 were in the luteal phase at the time of 
evaluation. In three women it was not possible to determine the 
menstrual cycle phase due to their menopausal status. Compari -
sons of anxiety and depression scores between phases revealed no 
significant differences in the median HDRS scores (follicular: 23.1, 
luteal: 20.6; t: 1.64, p: 0.107), SA (follicular: 44.00, luteal: 41.81; t: 
0.68, p: 0.49), and TA (follicular: 44.44, luteal: 42.27; t:0.91, 
p:0.37); the PSS scores were higher in the follicular phase Table 1

Correlation analysis is presented in Table 3; showing all the sample 
associations between hormone measurements (DHEA and cortisol) and 
clinimetric variables. It is observed a significant relation between 
cortisol and state anxiety, trait anxiety and perceived stress in all the 
participants, demonstrating that higher cortisol levels are associated 
with higher stress perception. No correlations are observed between 
depressive scores and hormonal levels. A separate analysis according to 
sex, shows a significant association between FT and perceived stress 
only in women (Fig. 1a), with a positive correlation: the higher the FT 
levels, the greater the perceived stress (Fig. 1b). Conversely, in males, 
this relationship is inverse, but no significant correlation was observed. 
Furthermore, in the sex-stratified analysis, the significant correlation 
between STAI scores and free testosterone in women does not remain. 
Lastly, a separate analysis in women, controlling for age, BMI, and 
menstrual cycle phase, demonstrated that free testosterone was 
consistently associated with PSS, with higher FT levels being 
related to higher perceived stress (Table 4). 
Discussion 
The role of testosterone in the presence of depression and anxiety is 
still unknown; complexity in conducting clinical trials could report 
inconsistent results, but the pathophysiological process involving an-
drogens makes the hypothesis that testosterone influences mood 
feasible. Additionally, testosterone levels may modulate cortisol 
reactivity, and some authors have stressed the importance of con-
trolling of sex hormone fluctuation when examining cortisol 
reactivity to stress [21]. In our study, we did not find an association 
between testosterone and cortisol levels, but we observed a posi-
tive correlation between anxiety scores and cortisol levels, with no 
differences between sexes. Depressive symptoms were not associ -
ated with cortisol levels in either men or women. The above leads 
us to suppose that cortisol is more closely related to the acute state 
of anxiety than to depression. However, it is important to remark 
that we did not measure cortisol reactivity but rather serum 
cortisol levels. 
The interaction between testosterone and neurotransmitters like 
dopamine and serotonin may explain its antidepressant effects [26]. 
Likewise, like other neuroactive steroids, testosterone acts as an allo-
steric modulator of GABA receptors. However, the differential effects of 
Testosterone on mood may be explained by factors such as sex or co-
morbid conditions like anxiety. In our study, we found no association 
between depressive score and testosterone levels in either men or women. However, anxiety was found to be associated with free testos -
terone, in a sex-dependent manner. 
When investigating the effects of testosterone on mood, several 
factors should be considered. Firstly, the sex of participants is important 
[23,26] , and in the case of women the reproductive stage should be 
taken into account. Additionally, it has been observed that some con-
ditions, such as being under stress, could modify the association between 
testosterone levels and affective symptoms. 
Studies in adolescents have observed that testosterone can modify 
the associations of most hormones with anxiety and depression [5]; 
while in women in menopausal transition, an increased testosterone 
level was associated with high depressive symptoms [4]. We previously 
reported a negative association between HDRS scores and free testos -
terone levels in unmedicated depressed women in the fertile stage [13]. 
In the cited paper, we did not evaluate anxiety in the participants, and 
we controlled the reproductive variables more strictly. Hence, we 
believe that these methodological differences account for the discrep -
ancies with the current report, where we were unable to find a rela-
tionship between depressive symptoms and testosterone. However, as a 
new contribution to the studied phenomenon, we can say that the 
modulation of anxiety by testosterone may differ between men and 
women, and could vary according to the instrument used to assess 
anxiety. When we compared two different dimensions of anxiety, we 
observed that only perceived stress was affected by testosterone. 
We used the PSS and the STAI questionnaires to evaluate anxiety. 
While both measurements assess cognitive symptoms of anxiety, the PSS 
is more focused on how a person feels in life situations, with higher 
scores indicating a sense of being overwhelmed and reduced self- 
efficacy, while STAI evaluates more physical and autonomic symp -
toms of anxiety, both in the present or across the life. It is worth noting 
that, according to neuroimaging studies, measures related to STAI did 
not exhibit any significant correlation with regions of limbic circuits 
[11]. Interesting studies have suggested that Testosterone reduces un-
conscious emotion of fear, but does not affect the consciously experi -
enced anxiety [38]. However, our results diverge from this finding, as 
we observed no reduction in conscious anxiety, as measured with the 
PSS, with increased testosterone levels. Instead, we noted a rise in 
perceived stress among women with high testosterone levels, remarking 
that this effect was observed only in women. We attribute these dis-
crepancies to the inclusion of patients with depression in our study, 
whereas the cited assessment was conducted in healthy women. More -
over, it is important to consider that the effect of exogenous testosterone 
may differ from endogenous hormone levels. 
Another important variable to consider when evaluating the rela-
tionship between anxiety and testosterone is the context in which

5participants are assessed. It is interesting to note studies that evaluate 
patients under psychological stress conditions. In this regard, the hy-
peractivity of the noradrenergic system might influence the Testos -
terone response in adolescents with anxiety disorders [14]. Challenging 
tasks that induce stress, particularly in individuals vulnerable to anxiety, 
contribute to the observed changes in the levels of testosterone, and 
testosterone itself could modify the response to stress [8,12,43] . In our 
study, we observed that perceived stress is modulated by testosterone. 
However, the measurement employed evaluates stress over the last 
month rather than a specific situation. Nevertheless, it is interesting to 
note that participants with a higher sense of being overwhelmed had 
higher free testosterone levels. 
The correlation of free, but not total, testosterone with anxiety 
symptoms in our sample can be explained based on the free hormone 
hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, the biological effectiveness of 
a particular hormone is more accurately represented by its free concentration rather than total hormone levels [29]. Some studies 
evaluating the association between androgens and anxiety or depressive 
symptoms, have assessed free testosterone levels. For example, a study 
conducted by Donbalo ˚glu Z and colleagues [10] found that FT was 
related with all psychological measures in women with polycystic 
ovaries syndrome. 
Based on the previous cited studies and considering the present 
study, we conclude that anxiety could be a modifier of the role that 
testosterone plays in depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, this role 
appears to differ between men and women. Moreover, we suggest that 
the evaluation of anxiety in clinical settings and research should be 
reappraised to allow for a more nuanced assessment that aligns with 
findings observed in brain imaging research. This research suggests that 
the subcortical circuits modulated by testosterone may play a crucial 
role in the anxious symptomatology [38,39] . 
Limitations 
The small sample size and cross-sectional design limit the general -
izability of our conclusions to the entire population and preclude the 
establishment of causality; additionally, patients had similar HDRS 
scores, which may have limited the possibility to find a correlation be-
tween depression severity and hormonal levels. Moreover, an impor -
tant limitation is the method used to measure FT and TT, which 
involves immunoassays, recognized for their lack of precision. 
Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution. While 
including anxious participants without depression as a comparative 
group could enhance the robustness of the findings, it is uncommon to 
encounter this population in clinical scenarios. Future research should 
examine the correlation between clinimetric evaluation of anxiety and 
brain changes documented by images research. 
Conclusion 
We observed differences in the effect of testosterone on anxiety be-
tween men and women. In our sample, free testosterone was associated 
with an increase in perceived stress. This suggests that its levels may 
modulate how women perceive stressful life situations. However, these 
results should be interpreted with caution due to limitations in the 
present study. Unlike other studies, we did not observe a relationship 
between testosterone and depressive symptoms, which could be due to a 
small sample size or the fact that all participants in this study had similar 
levels of depressive symptoms; however, we cannot rule out the possi -
bility that testosterone does not influence depression, but rather the 
symptoms often associated with it, such as anxiety.
