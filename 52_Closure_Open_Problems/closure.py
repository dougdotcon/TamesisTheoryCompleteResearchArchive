    1. WHY PHYSICS IS FRAGMENTED
       - GR, QFT, Thermo, etc. occupy distinct regime points
       - Their invariants are incompatible
       - No reduction to a single framework is possible
    
    2. WHY ToE ATTEMPTS FAIL
       - String Theory, LQG, Holography all violate no-go theorems
       - They try to unify incompatible invariants
       - This is structural, not technical
    
    3. WHAT KIND OF UNITY EXISTS
       - Physics is a graph, not a pyramid
       - Unity is in transitions, not endpoints
       - Universality is local, not global
    
    4. THE U_{1/2} DISCOVERY
       - Specific universality class for discrete-to-random transitions
       - Critical exponent alpha = 0.5
       - Mechanism: Bernoulli perturbation + cycle counting

    1. THE VALUES OF CONSTANTS
       - TRI says Lambda, a_0, M_c belong to different regimes
       - It does NOT predict their numerical values
       - That requires regime-specific theories
    
    2. EMERGENCE MECHANISMS
       - TRI classifies transitions by invariants
       - It does NOT explain HOW new regimes emerge from old
       - That's a different research program
    
    3. CONSCIOUSNESS, LIFE, COMPLEXITY
       - TRI is about physical regimes, not higher-order phenomena
       - No claims about emergence of life or mind
    
    4. THE "ORIGIN" QUESTION
       - Why do these particular regimes exist?
       - Why these invariants and not others?
       - TRI takes regimes as given, not derived

    1. NEW UNIVERSALITY CLASSES
       - Are there classes beyond U_{1/2}, U_2, U_0, U_Ising?
       - What are the invariant signatures of undiscovered classes?
       - Prediction: there are exactly as many classes as invariant combinations
    
    2. TRANSITION DYNAMICS
       - How does a system cross from one regime to another?
       - Is there a meta-dynamics of regime transitions?
       - This connects to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics
    
    3. QUANTUM GRAVITY ALTERNATIVES
       - Given the no-go theorem, what CAN we hope for?
       - Perhaps: effective descriptions at different scales
       - Not unification, but correspondence
    
    4. MATHEMATICAL FORMALIZATION
       - Category theory of regimes?
       - Topology of regime space?
       - Algebraic structure of invariants?
    
    5. EXPERIMENTAL TESTS
       - Can we experimentally verify universality class membership?
       - Can we find new transitions and classify them?
       - The atlas is extensible, not closed

    TRI provides a FRAMEWORK for future research:
    
    1. Any new ToE claim can be checked:
       - What regimes does it claim to unify?
       - What are their invariants?
       - Does it violate the no-go theorems?
    
    2. Any new transition can be classified:
       - What is its (S, P, O) structure?
       - What is its critical exponent?
       - Which universality class does it belong to?
    
    3. Any new regime can be mapped:
       - Add it to the regime catalog
       - Identify its transitions
       - Extend the graph
    
    TRI is not a closed theory. It's an open framework
    that organizes and constrains future work.

    This is not a defeat. This is a mature understanding.
    
    We do not have a Theory of Everything.
    We have something more valuable:
    
    A THEORY OF THE LIMITS OF EVERYTHING.
    
    And limits, unlike laws, can be proven.
