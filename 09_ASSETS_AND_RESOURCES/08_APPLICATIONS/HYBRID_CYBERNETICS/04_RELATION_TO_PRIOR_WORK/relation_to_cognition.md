# Relation to Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)

**Hybrid Cybernetics** can be viewed as the information-theoretic generalization of **Cognitive Load Theory** (Sweller, 1988).

---

## The Mapping

| Cognitive Load Theory | Hybrid Cybernetics |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Working Memory** | **Channel Capacity ($C_{bio}$)** |
| **Intrinsic Load** | **Task Entropy ($S_{task}$)** |
| **Extraneous Load** | **Interface Entropy ($S_{interface}$)** |
| **Germane Load** | **Schema Construction ($dI/dt$)** |

## The Innovation

CLT typically focuses on *learning* (Schema acquisition). Hybrid Cybernetics focuses on *performance* (Inference Stability).
We posit that **GenAI imposes a massive Extraneous Load** (the need to verify stochastic text) masquerading as assistance.
Our formalism proves that if the Cost of Verification exceeds the Cost of Generation, the tool yields **Negative Cognitive Utility**.
