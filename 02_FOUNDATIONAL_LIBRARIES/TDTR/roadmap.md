# TDTR — Theory of the Dynamics of Regime Transitions

## Master Roadmap: Stages 53–78

**Status: COMPLETE**  
**Start Date: 2026-01-23**  
**Completion Date: 2026-01-23**
**Predecessors: Tamesis (1-42, CLOSED), TRI (43-52, COMPLETE)**

---

## Central Thesis

> **Physics resides in the laws governing TRANSITIONS between incompatible regimes, not in the regimes themselves.**

---

## The Object

**Edges of the physics graph, not nodes.**
