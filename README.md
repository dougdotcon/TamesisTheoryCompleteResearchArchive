# COMPLETE RESEARCH ARCHIVE: Tamesis / TRI / TDTR

**Status: ALL PROGRAMS CLOSED**
**Date:** 2026-01-23

This archive contains the complete history of three sequential research programs investigating the unification of physics.

---

## 1. Tamesis Program (Stages 1-42)

**Goal:** Derive a Theory of Everything (ToE) from spectral operators.
**Outcome:** **FAILED** (Refuted by Tamesis Action Test).
**Key Discovery:** Discovery of the $U_{1/2}$ Universality Class (Discrete-to-Random transitions).

## 2. TRI Program (Stages 43-52)

**Goal:** Explain why unification failed.
**Outcome:** **COMPLETE**.
**Key Result:** **Theory of Regime Incompatibility (TRI)**.

- Proved 3 No-Go Theorems preventing unification of discrete/continuous and quantum/gravity regimes.
- Established that physics is a graph of incompatible regimes, not a single pyramid.

## 3. TDTR Program (Stages 53-86)

**Goal:** Formalize the dynamics of transitions between regimes.
**Outcome:** **COMPLETE & VALIDATED**.
**Key Result:** **Theory of the Dynamics of Regime Transitions (TDTR)**.

- **Irreversibility:** Proved transitions form a semigroup (no inverses).
- **Quantum Gravity:** Solved as an irreversible coarse-graining transition ($QFT \to GR$).
- **Dark Matter:** Explained as the elastic memory of the holographic screen ($a < a_0$).
- **Validation:** Successfully simulated emergent Newton, Galaxy Rotation Curves (without dark matter), and Spacetime Emergence.
