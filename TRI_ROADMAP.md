# TRI — THEORY OF REGIME INCOMPATIBILITY

## Master Roadmap: Stages 43–52

**Status: ACTIVE**  
**Start Date: 2026-01-23**  
**Predecessor: Tamesis Program (Stages 1-42, CLOSED)**

---

## Central Thesis

> **There exists no single axiomatic framework capable of describing all physical regimes simultaneously, because the fundamental mechanisms that define each regime are mathematically incompatible.**

Unification fails by **necessity**, not ignorance.

---

## The Object

This is NOT a Theory of Everything.  
This is a **Meta-Theory of Regime Incompatibility**.

It explains WHY:

- Physics is fragmented (GR, QFT, Thermo, Chaos, Information)
- Constants don't unify (Lambda, a_0, M_c belong to regimes, not universe)
- Emergence is structural, not semantic

---

## Phase I — Formalization (Stages 43–45)

### Stage 43: Formal Definition of "Regime"

**Objective**: Remove "regime" from informal discourse.

**Definition**: A regime is a mathematical triple:

```
R = (S, P, O)
```

where:

- S = state space type (discrete/continuous/hybrid)
- P = perturbation type (Bernoulli/Gaussian/threshold)
- O = observable type (counting/spectral/threshold)

**Deliverables**:

- [ ] Formal definition with examples
- [ ] Mapping: GR, QFT, Thermo, Chaos, Information → distinct R
- [ ] Python implementation of regime structure

---

### Stage 44: Regime Invariants

**Objective**: Identify what does NOT change within a regime.

**Invariant Types**:

- Measure type (counting vs spectral)
- Commutativity / non-commutativity
- Locality / non-locality
- Continuity / discreteness

**Deliverables**:

- [ ] Minimal invariant list per U_alpha class
- [ ] Empirical proof: change invariant → change exponent

---

### Stage 45: Map of Known Regimes

**Objective**: Build the "world map" of physics.

**Deliverables**:

- [ ] Complete table: `Regime | S | P | O | U_alpha`
- [ ] Locate: GR, QFT, Decoherence, MOND, Quantum Collapse, Classical Chaos
- [ ] Demonstrate: no common center exists

---

## Phase II — Formal Incompatibility (Stages 46–48)

### Stage 46: Compatibility Criterion

**Objective**: Answer mathematically: when can two regimes coexist?

**Key Definition**:
> Two regimes R_1, R_2 are compatible iff they share the same structural invariants.

**Deliverables**:

- [ ] Necessary and sufficient compatibility criterion
- [ ] Positive examples (QFT <-> decoherence)
- [ ] Negative examples (GR <-> quantum collapse)

---

### Stage 47: No-Unification Theorems

**Objective**: Formulate the no-go theorems of TRI.

**Example Theorem**:
> There exists no theory T such that:
>
> - T has both continuous AND discrete state space
> - T preserves both counting AND spectrum as fundamental observables

**Deliverables**:

- [ ] 2-3 formal impossibility theorems
- [ ] Each linked to a clear structural conflict

---

### Stage 48: Why ALL ToEs Fail

**Objective**: Explain the structural failure of every ToE attempt.

**Cases Analyzed**:

- String Theory
- Loop Quantum Gravity
- Holographic Unification
- Tamesis Action (explicitly)

**Deliverables**:

- [ ] Table: `Theory | Regimes Attempted | Fatal Incompatibility`

---

## Phase III — Transitions as Fundamental (Stages 49–50)

### Stage 49: General Theory of Transitions

**Objective**: Show that what exists are not universal laws, but transition laws.

**Formalism**:

```
R_1 --[Mechanism]--> R_2
```

**Deliverables**:

- [ ] Classification of possible mechanisms
- [ ] Connection to Tamesis: U_{1/2}, U_2, U_0 as concrete examples
- [ ] Physics as a GRAPH of regimes, not a pyramid

---

### Stage 50: Universality as Local Property

**Objective**: Close the epistemological cycle.

**Key Result**:
> Universality is NOT global.  
> Universality is LOCAL to a transition.

**Deliverables**:

- [ ] Proof: no "total universal class" can exist
- [ ] Connection to RG without reductionism

---

## Phase IV — Consolidation (Stages 51–52)

### Stage 51: TRI Founding Paper

**Title**: "The Theory of Regime Incompatibility: Why No Theory of Everything Can Exist"

**Content**:

- Definition of regimes
- Atlas of universality classes
- Impossibility theorems
- Transitions as fundamental object

---

### Stage 52: Closure & Open Problems

**Objective**: Close without dogmatizing.

**Deliverables**:

- [ ] What TRI explains
- [ ] What TRI does NOT attempt to explain
- [ ] Where new classes may exist
- [ ] How future programs connect

---

## Historical Context

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Unifiers | Newton, Einstein |
| Limit-Provers | Godel, Turing, Bell, Coleman-Mandula |

**TRI belongs to the second category.**

No-go theorems are eternal.
