# Experimental Task Definition: The "Needle in the Haystack" Protocol

**Objective:** To induce Information Saturation in the Human Operator ($O_H$) while maintaining a high baseline performance requirement.

---

## 1. The Task: High-Entropy Technical Review

The subject is presented with a technical document (Code or Legal Text) generated by a Stochastic Operator ($O_M$, e.g., GPT-4).

- **Length:** 10,000 tokens (approx. 40 minutes reading time at normal speed).
- **Density:** Supercritical. The text contains subtle, plausible, but factually false insertions ("Hallucinations").
- **Goal:** Identify and correct all $N_{err}$ errors within time $T$.

## 2. Saturation Induction

To guarantee the system operates in the regime of interest ($\Phi_{in} > C_{max}$), we impose a time constraint $T_{limit}$ such that:
$$ \frac{\text{Tokens}}{T_{limit}} > 2 \times \text{AvgReadingSpeed} $$
This forces the operator to rely on heuristic filtering (Hybrid Cybernetics) rather than linear verification (Classical Reading).

## 3. Error Typology

The errors injected/generated are strictly classified:

1. **Syntactic Errors:** Trivially detectable (Low Entropy).
2. **Semantic Errors:** Plausible but false (High Entropy). *Target of study.*
3. **Contextual Errors:** Contradictions with external premises (Requires Long-Context Awareness).

## 4. The Control Variable: The Filter $\mathcal{F}$

We test different interface designs (Filters) to see which one stabilizes the error rate:

- **$\mathcal{F}_{raw}$:** Raw text (No Filter).
- **$\mathcal{F}_{highlighter}$:** AI pre-flags suspicious segments (Attention Steering).
- **$\mathcal{F}_{compression}$:** Summarized gist + Drill-down (Bandwidth Reduction).
