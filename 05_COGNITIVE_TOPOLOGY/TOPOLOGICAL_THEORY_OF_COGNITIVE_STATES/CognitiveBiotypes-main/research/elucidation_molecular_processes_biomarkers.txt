Molecular mechanisms ABSTRACT  
Objectives: We aimed to identify the significant genetic variations and molecular mechanisms associated with the 
pathogenesis of mood disorders associated with genetic variants. 
Methods: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS, ID: EFO_0003761), ClueGO plug-in, and GEO database were 
the main approaches. 
Results: Ten biomarkers that are frequently related to mood disorders were identified across all studies. In terms 
of mood disorders, a collection of biomarkers has been found, with specific attention given to seven fundamental 
genetic variations. A comprehensive analysis revealed a total of five central biomarkers that exhibited a sig-
nificant association with unipolar depression, with an additional five central biomarkers that demonstrated a 
significant association with mixed traits. Biomarkers that have been linked to an increased vulnerability to mood 
disorders have been found to disrupt many cellular processes in neuronal development, including cell 
morphogenesis, cell projection organization, and cell adhesion. The main signaling pathways associated with 
biomarkers that contribute to a reduced susceptibility to mood disorders encompass the activation of neuro 
projection morphogenesis, O-linked glycosylation, modulation of chemical synaptic transmission, and G-protein- 
coupled glutamate receptor activity. hsa-miR-3937, hsa-miR-4499, and hsa-miR-7106-5p exhibited the most 
significant downregulation in the GSE182194 dataset. A microRNA (hsa-miR-26b-5p) and transcription factors 
(zinc finger proteins) were found to have a pivotal role in the elucidation of genetic variations linked to mood 
disorders across different datasets (EFO_0003761, GSE101521, and GSE217811). 
Conclusions: Our findings provide a foundational framework for prospective therapeutic approaches aimed at 
addressing mood disorders, specifically focusing on the genetic variants and pathways linked to this condition.   
Introduction 
Mood disorders, commonly known as affective disorders, are a 
collection of psychiatric conditions characterized by a disruption in 
mood as the primary underlying characteristic. Mood disorders pose a 
significant worldwide mental health dilemma. During the year 2019, 
around 970 million individuals worldwide, which accounts for 1 in 
every 8 people, were afflicted with mood disorders [1]. According to the 
DSM-5, mood disorders are categorized into two primary types: (1) 
major depressive disorders (unipolar depression) are defined by a 
persistently low mood, accompanied by feelings of hopelessness and sadness; and (2) bipolar disorders are characterized by altering episodes 
of depression and periods of mania and hypomania [2]. However, mood 
disturbances are present in nearly all mental disorders, particularly 
schizophrenia, eating disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders 
(autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) 
[1]. Furthermore, anxiety disorders, which are distinguished by sensa -
tions of fear, nervousness, and anxiety, are typically encompassed 
within the classification of mood disorders. Anxiety disorder is also a 
comprehensive classification of diseases that includes several subtypes 
such as posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, obsessi -
ve–compulsive disorder, and social phobia [3]. These disorders have

2numerous subtypes and share similar symptoms and pathology, making 
it important to pinpoint the key genetic factors involved. Hence, 
research on the molecular mechanisms implicated in these disorders is 
of utmost importance to identify crucial biomarkers that can distinguish 
the pathophysiological pathways among these disorders. 
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide promising bio-
markers for the detection of mood disorders as well as predictors for the 
effectiveness of therapy and the prognosis of patients diagnosed with 
mood disorders [4]. Accumulating data indicates that GWAS has effec-
tively identified genetic variants linked to the pathogenesis of mood 
disorders inside specific genes [5,6] . For example, a meta-analysis study 
involving 807,553 participants (246,363 with depression and 561,190 
without depression) from three GWAS on depression identified 269 
genes, 102 distinct genetic variations, and 15 gene sets that are linked to 
depression. These findings include genes and gene pathways related to 
the structure of synapses and the transmission of neurotransmitters [5]. 
Our hypothesis suggests that genetic variations in specific genes may 
contribute to the molecular processes linked with mood disorders. These 
genetic variants have the potential to affect signaling pathways that play 
important roles in mood disorder etiology. They could be promising 
targets for developing diagnostics and preventive drugs for mood dis-
orders. Thus, this study aimed to identify the hub genetic variations and 
their associated molecular mechanisms that contribute to the risk of 
mood disorders, unipolar depression, and mixed traits using GWAS data 
from 299 studies. 
Methods 
Identification of potential genetic variations involved in the pathogenesis of 
mood disorders 
The current investigation employed data on “unipolar depression ” 
sourced from the GWAS database (ID: EFO_0003761) in order to explore 
the potential of genetic variations as biomarkers for prognostic and 
therapeutic responses among people diagnosed with mood disorders. 
The data was acquired on November 7th, 2023. The dataset comprises a 
total of 2668 variant and risk alleles obtained from 299 studies. It en-
compasses 58 symptoms (e.g., neurotic depressions, endogenous de-
pressions, and emotional depressions), 179 traits (e.g., anxiety and 
major depressive disorder, activities undertaken to treat depression, 
etc.), and two child traits (postpartum depression and treatment- 
resistant depression). In the present investigation, an initial step was 
taken to exclude a total of 1462 data entries that were found to have 
missing beta indicators in the designated “Beta ” tab. Subsequently, a 
total of 562 records were eliminated from the analysis due to the pres-
ence of ambiguous variant and risk allele information. Finally, a total of 
1037 records were selected for subsequent processing (Table S1). To 
investigate the molecular pathways involved in the development of 
mood disorders related to genetic variants, we selectively retained re-
cords that exhibited the highest beta indicator and the smallest p-values. 
In this study, mixed traits were defined if participants had more than one 
disease such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, unipolar 
depression, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, 
etc. 
Identification of potential molecular mechanisms involved in genetic 
variations and mood disorders 
Following the findings of the candidate genetic variants, we pro-
ceeded to conduct the enrichment analysis. The pathway analysis was 
conducted using the CytoscapeClueGO plug-in, namely version 2.5.8. 
The decision to utilize the KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways data-
bases was undertaken with the aim of acquiring a comprehensive ag-
gregation of signaling pathways. The enrichment analysis was 
performed using the two-sided hypergeometric test, which included a 
Bonferroni step-down adjustment. The terms exhibited a connection or association with one another, as indicated by a κ score of 0.4. The 
ClueGO plug-in facilitates the integration of Gene Ontology (GO) ter-
minology and KEGG/BioCarta pathways [7]. The incorporation of this 
plug-in facilitates the visualization of molecular pathways and gene 
ontologies associated with the genetic variants being examined. More -
over, it enables the evaluation of functional annotations in a compara -
tive manner between two clusters. The current investigation utilized a 
plug-in tool to elucidate the molecular pathways that are correlated 
with the genetic alterations being examined and are connected to mood 
disorders. The construction of protein –protein interaction (PPI) net-
works was carried out by utilizing the STRING v12.0 database, followed 
by subsequent adjustments using Cytoscape v3.9.1. The evaluation of 
protein –protein interactions (PPI) was conducted by analyzing physical 
interactions that exhibited a substantial level of confidence, as denoted 
by a physical score over 0.4 in the STRING database. The Cytoscape 
plug-in known as “CytoHubba ” was utilized in order to extract a hub PPI 
network. The establishment of this network entailed the amalgamation 
of subnetworks generated by using degree, closeness, and betweenness 
methodologies, utilizing the technique of intersectional merging. The 
Venn diagram tool was utilized to ascertain the proteins that are com-
mon among the subnetworks encompassing the top 10 nodes, which 
were ranked using degree, proximity, and betweenness methodologies 
[8]. 
The identification of proteoforms resulting from post-translational 
modifications (PTMs) was conducted by utilizing the UniProt database 
following the execution of the protein –protein interaction (PPI) study 
[9]. The categorization of the examined biomarkers was performed 
using the Panther classification methodology [10]. The level of hub 
protein expression in brain tissues was evaluated by utilizing the Human 
Protein Atlas, which may be accessed at the following web address: 
https://www.proteinatlas.org/. The ChIP-X Enrichment Analysis 
Version 3 (CHEA3) was utilized in order to determine the transcription 
factors that are potentially responsible for the observed genomic 
changes [11]. The current program utilizes data obtained from the 
ENCODE and ReMap GTEx datasets to identify transcription factors 
[12]. The development of the integrated regulatory network was con-
ducted with the software tool Cytoscape. This process involved the se-
lection of the top 10 transcription factors, which were chosen based on 
their mean rank score. Subsequently, the MicroRNA Enrichment Turned 
Network (MIENTURNET) was utilized to produce and examine networks 
illustrating the connections between microRNA and its target bio-
markers [13]. The functional enrichment analysis utilized the KEGG, 
Reactome, and WikiPathway databases in conjunction with the diseases 
ontology database. P-values are determined by the cumulative hyper -
geometric distribution, whereas q-values are determined using the 
Benjamini-Hochberg process to correct for multiple comparisons 
[14,15] . Following the enrichment analysis, our stringent criteria for 
result inclusion further solidified the integrity of our findings. Only 
those with p-values D0.05 and a false discovery rate (FDR) D0.05 were 
retained. This dual-step procedure enabled a comprehensive assessment 
of statistical significance and correction for multiple comparisons. 
To strengthen our findings, we continued to investigate the associ -
ation between miRNAs and transcription factors involved in the path-
ogenesis of mood disorders. For our analysis, we extensively searched 
for and selected different datasets from the GEO database until May 5, 
2024. We found three datasets that were implicated in miRNAs, genes, 
and mood disorders (GSE182194, GSE101521, and GSE217811). The 
GEO2R-analyzed function was used to identify key miRNAs and tran-
scription factors. The data underwent a natural log transformation 
before analysis. We applied adjustments to the P-values using Benjamini 
and Hochberg (false discovery rate). The significance level cut-off for the 
p-value was set at 0.05. Volcano and mean-difference plot contrasts 
were selected up to 5. The figure panels were generated using the web- 
based platform BioRender.com . The study employed the R programming 
language version 4.0.2 to do general data transformations and group -
ings. These tasks were accomplished using the tidyverse package H. Duc Nguyen et al.

Results 
Characteristics of genetic variations associated with mood disorders 
The unipolar depression dataset (GWAS, EFO_0003761) includes 
2668 variant and risk alleles, 179 traits, and 2 child traits (postpartum 
depression and treatment-resistant depression) obtained from 299 
studies. Most variant and risk alleles are distributed across chromosomes 
1–22, especially two of them in the X chromosome and one in the Y 
chromosome (Fig. 1A). Ten common genes associated with variants and 
risk alleles (DCC, TCF4, SORCS3, RBFOX1, LINC03000, NIHCOLE, 
GRM5, RNU6-334P, TMEM106B, MPZL1, AKAP8P1, ADCY10, and 
JKAMPP1) were observed across previous studies (Fig. 1B). The ma-
jority of variations related to these genes were double natured (increase 
(↑) risk or decrease (↓) risk). LINC03000, NIHCOLE, GRM5, RNU6-334P, 
TMEM106B, MPZL1, and AKAP8P1 were found to be associated with 
unipolar depression, while TCF4, SORCS3, and ADCY10 were related to 
mixed traits (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, unipolar 
depression, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, 
etc.). 24 % and 18 % of these genes exert binding and catalytic activity 
(Fig. 1C). In this study, we only kept records with detailed information 
on allele location and the risk of mood disorders. There were 1505 re-
cords (689 increase risk and 816 decrease risk) implicated in the path-
ogenesis of mood disorders for further analysis. We also found 825 and 
681 variations underlying the etiology of unipolar depression and mixed 
traits for subgroup analysis (Fig. 1D). There was significant evidence of 
decreased neuronal and synaptic functions involved in the etiology of 
mood disorders associated with the studied variations (Fig. 1E). Identification of hub genetic variations associated with mood disorders 
Next, we identified the hub genes associated with variants and risk 
alleles underlying mood disorders using network topological analysis. 
As shown in Fig. 2A, 7 hub genes (DRD2 (↑rs7125588-A or ↓rs7111031- 
C), PLCG1 (↑rs2228246-G), TLR4 (↑rs2149351-T), H3C12 (↓rs483143- 
C), CNTNAP2 (↓rs11971943-G), RPS3 (↑rs3018100-G), and NCAM1 
(↑rs1940709-A or ↓rs9919557-T)) were observed, in which NCAM1 had 
the highest scores of degrees, betweenness, and closeness. NCAM1 was 
found to express all regions of the brain, especially white matter 
(Figure B-C). NCAM1 showed a high correlation (r 0.91) with IKROS 
family zinc Fig. 5 (Fig. 2D), which is a biomarker for depression [16]. As 
shown in Fig. 2E, NCAM1 acts as a transporter and also interacts with 
other enzymes (STUB1 and GRK2), which are linked to depression 
[17,18] . On the other hand, NCAM1 also exerts glycosylation (29 %) and 
modified residues in PTM analysis (Fig. 2F and Table S2). Biomarkers, 
which were implicated in an increased risk of mood disorders, were 
found to disrupt cell morphogenesis, cell projection organization, and 
cell adhesion involved in neuron differentiation. Similar to that, acti-
vation of neuro projection morphogenesis, modulation of chemical 
synaptic transmission, and G-protein-coupled glutamate receptor ac-
tivity were the predominant signaling pathways, which were associated 
with biomarkers underlying reduced risk of mood disorders (Fig. 2G-I). 
Identification of hub genetic variations associated with unipolar depression 
and mixed traits 
Next, we stratified and analyzed the association between the studied 
biomarkers and unipolar depression and mixed traits. Five hub bio-
markers (NCAM1 (↑rs1940709-A or ↓rs9919557-T), TRL4 (↑rs2149351- 
T), DRD2 (↑rs7125588-A or ↓rs7111031-C), PLCG1 (↑rs2228246-G), 
and H3C12 (↓rs483143-C)) and five other hub markers (NCAM1

(↑rs11693031-A or ↓rs74865692-T), CNTNAP2 (↓rs11971943-G), and 
WWOX (↑rs56858262-A or ↓rs7199110-A)) were observed to be impli -
cated in the pathogenesis of unipolar depression and mixed traits, 
respectively (Fig. 3A-B). Similar to mood disorders, NCAM1 was listed as 
the most important biomarker. Disruption of cell–cell adhesion was 
associated with biomarkers causing unipolar depression development, 
whereas improved cell–cell adhesion and G-protein-coupled glutamate 
receptor activity were important signaling pathways related to bio-
markers, which reduced the risk of unipolar depression (Fig. 3C-E). In 
terms of mixed traits, reduced G-protein-coupled glutamate receptor 
activity was observed as the key signaling pathways related to bio-
markers with high risk of mixed traits, while increased O-linked glyco -
sylation and neuron projection morphogenesis were significant molecular mechanisms associated with biomarkers with low risk of 
mixed traits (Fig. 3F-H). 
Identification of miRNAs and transcription factors associated with mood 
disorders, unipolar depression, and mixed traits 
miRNAs are naturally occurring, non-coding RNA molecules that are 
small in length, typically consisting of 19–25 nucleotides. Most miRNAs 
are found to be expressed in the brain and have significant functions in 
brain development such as regulation of synapses, neural plasticity, and 
nerve growth [19]. Growing evidence suggests that single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) or variations in miRNA sequences have the po-
tential to disrupt various biological processes by impacting miRNA 
target selection, thereby closely linking them to various human diseases

5[20]. The association between genetic mutations in miRNAs and sus-
ceptibility to cancer has garnered increasing interest. Recent studies 
have highlighted that SNPs associated with miRNAs can significantly 
disrupt the biogenesis and function of these miRNAs, potentially acting 
as oncogenic or tumor-suppressive molecules in human cancers [21,22] . 
On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that miRNAs play a role 
in the pathogenesis of depression as well as mood disorders [23,24] . In 
this study, we observed that three miRNAs (hsa-miR-17-5p, hsa-miR- 
335-5p, and hsa-miR-26b-5p) were predominant miRNAs associated 
with glutamate receptor activity, Hedgehog signaling pathway, Prader- 
Willi and Angelman syndrome, DNA damage response, and the 
corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling pathway, which were attrib -
uted to the pathogenesis of mood disorders. On the other hand, we also 
found three miRNAs (hsa-miR-17-5p, hsa-miR-335-5p, and has-let-7b- 
5p) and two miRNAs (hsa-miR-17-5p and hsa-miR-335-5p) were asso-
ciated with neurotransmitter release, apoptosis, and GABA receptor 
activity, which were underlying the pathogenesis of unipolar depression 
and mixed traits, respectively (Fig. 4A and Table S3A-C). 
SNPs that are found in areas related to DNA methylation, tran-
scription factor binding, or miRNA target sites can change how genes are expressed [25]. Transcription factors regulate the initiation of tran-
scription and the expression of genes by binding to particular DNA re-
gions. Dysregulation of transcription factors can impact 
neurotransmitter systems, neuroplasticity, and stress response pathways 
by causing aberrant expression of genes linked to depression [26,27] . 
MYT1L (Myelin Transcription Factor 1-Like), ZNF80A4 (zinc finger 
protein 804A), and NPAS3 (Neuronal PAS Domain Protein 3) were 
denoted as the predominant transcription factors that interacted with 
biomarkers underlying the pathogenesis of mood disorders, unipolar 
disorder, and mixed traits, respectively (Fig. 4B). 
To strengthen our findings, we conducted an extensive analysis of the 
association between miRNAs and transcription factors implicated in the 
pathogenesis of mood disorders, utilizing various datasets from the GEO 
database (GSE182194, GSE101521, and GSE217811). In the 
GSE182194 dataset, we found 211 miRNAs that were downregulated (p- 
value adjusted D0.05) in adult outpatients with mild to major depres -
sion and healthy volunteers. Notably, hsa-miR-3937 exhibited the most 
significant downregulation, followed by hsa-miR-4499 and hsa-miR- 
7106-5p (Fig. 5A-C). Furthermore, we identified 38 upregulated and 
downregulated genes associated with mood disorders (p-value adjusted 
Fig. 2. (continued ). H. Duc Nguyen et al.

6D0.05) (Fig. 5D). In the GSE101521 dataset, hsa-miR-26b-5p and 
ZFF331 emerged as key miRNAs (with high expression) and transcrip -
tion factors (with high mean rank) (Fig. 5E-F). Similarly, analysis of the 
GSE217811 dataset revealed 392 upregulated and downregulated genes 
linked to mood disorder (p-value adjusted D0.05) (Fig. 5G), with hsa- 
miR-26b-5p and ZFF433 identified as key miRNAs and transcription 
factors, respectively (Fig. 5H-I). Subsequently, enrichment analysis was 
performed to identify diseases associated with these miRNAs. Remark -
ably, hsa-miR-26b-5p and hsa-miR-16-5p were implicated in the etiol-
ogy of mood disorder (Fig. 5 J). 
Discussion 
This analysis utilized GWAS data from 299 studies to identify the 
major genetic variations and their corresponding biological pathways 
that contribute to the susceptibility to mood disorders, unipolar 
depression, and mixed traits. Seven key biomarkers —DRD2, PLCG1, 
TLR4, H3C12, CNTNAP2, RPS3, and NCAM1 —associated with varia -
tions and risk alleles were shown to be linked to the etiology of mood 
disorders. Additionally, we found that the etiology of unipolar depres -
sion was underpinned by five hub genes associated with variants and 
risk alleles: NCAM1, TRL4, DRD2, PLCG1, and H3C12. In contrast, the 
pathogenesis of mixed traits was associated with five other hub genes 
associated with variants and risk alleles: NCAM1, NERG1, ERBB4, 
CNTNAP2, and WWOX. Remarkably, NCAM1 is a common and pre-
dominant gene underlying the pathogenesis of mood disorders. There 
was evidence of significant disrupted cell morphogenesis, cell projection 
organization, and cell adhesion involved in neuron differentiation 
associated with variants with a high risk of mood disorders, while there 
was evidence of substantial activation of neuron projection morpho -
genesis, modulation of chemical synaptic transmission, and G-protein- 
coupled glutamate receptor activity associated with variants with a low 
risk of mood disorders. On the other hand, we also observed several 
miRNAs (hsa-miR-17-5p, hsa-miR-335-5p) and transcription factors 
(MYT1L, ZNF80A4, and NPAS3) underlying the etiology of mood 
disorder. 
Potential main genes underlying the pathogenesis of mood disorders 
NCAM1, also known as neural cell adhesion molecule 1, is respon -
sible for producing cell adhesion proteins that belong to the immuno -
globulin superfamily. NCAM1 participates in intercellular and extracellular interactions during the processes of development and dif-
ferentiation. NCAM1 also contributes to the formation of the nervous 
system by controlling the processes of neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth, 
and cell migration [28]. In vivo, it was observed that the deficiency of 
NCAM in mice can lead to the manifestation of a phenotype like 
depression [29]. Using GWAS data, Jona et al. observed a relationship 
between NCAM1 gene set and depression, as well as their corresponding 
brain anatomical characteristics, in a group of healthy young individuals 
[30]. An analysis of 11 depressive patients and 15 controls revealed a 
decrease in NCAM1 expression in the patients with unipolar depression 
as compared to controls [31]. Sequeria et al. also noted a decrease in the 
expression of NCAM2 in the hippocampus of depressive patients who 
died by suicide, as compared with their counterparts [32]. In this study, 
we also found NCAM1 to be the predominant gene implicated in the 
etiology of mood disorders, unipolar depression, and mixed traits. Two 
distinct variations (↑rs1940709-A and ↓rs9919557-T) were found in 
separate loci in close proximity. These findings suggest that a decrease in 
NCAM1 expression or altered NCAM1 function may possibly be involved 
in impaired cellular proliferation in the pathophysiology of mood 
disorders. 
DRD2 (D2 dopamine receptor) plays a crucial role in the dopami -
nergic system, which was found to be implicated in the pathogenesis of 
mood disorders [33]. Multiple genetic variations of DRD2 have been 
found, such as rs1800497 (TaqIA), rs1039089, rs877138, rs6277 (957C 
FT), rs1799732 (single bond 141C ins/del) polymorphisms, etc. 
[34–37]. A recent systematic study of 27 genetic variations in the DRD2 
gene revealed a significant association between the rs1800497 poly-
morphism and an increased risk of post-traumatic stress disorder, 
particularly among Caucasians and Asians. Additionally, there is a 
strong correlation between the rs1799978 and rs2075652 poly-
morphisms of the DRD2 gene and unipolar depression [38]. In line with 
that, our study also observed that DRD2 was a major biomarker for 
mood disorders and unipolar depression. Remarkably, DRD2 
(rs7125588-A) was found to be related to a high risk of mood disorders 
and unipolar depression, while DRD2 (rs7111031-C) showed opposite 
trends. The results suggest that genetic variations in DRD2 may be po-
tential risk factors for both mood disorders and unipolar depression and 
could be useful for predicting, preventing, diagnosing, and treating both 
conditions in the future. 
PLCG1 (Phospholipase C gamma 1) regulates neuronal activity, 
playing a crucial role in the functioning and growth of synapses. 
Disruption of PLCG1 signaling has been found to be associated with

7schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression, as well as lithium 
treatment response in patients with bipolar depression [39–41]. A 
microarray analysis of two datasets (GSE76826 and GSE98793) reported 
an association between PLCG1 upregulation, neuroinflammation, syn-
apse function, innate immunity, and unipolar depression [42]. 
Conversely, when the expression of PLCG1 is lost in the forebrain of 
mice, it results in manic-like behavior, including a decrease in 
depression-like behavior [43]. In the postmortem brains of certain sui-
cide victims, PLCG1 expression is lacking, although it is present in 
control participants [44]. Antidepressants have been found to stimulate 
PLCG1 in mice, which supports its involvement in treating depression 
[45]. In conjunction with previous evidence, our study also observed 
that PLCG1 was positively associated with the risk of mood disorders 
and unipolar depression, notably PLCG1 (rs2228246-G). There was a 
dearth of information on PLCG1 polymorphisms in mood disorders, so these findings may pave the way for future studies on identifying the 
exact molecular mechanisms implicated in the etiology of mood 
disorders. 
TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) is a type of receptor that detects specific 
patterns and is found in several types of cells (e.g., neurons, microglia, 
macrophages, astrocytes, etc.). TLR4 plays a function in regulating the 
body ’s response to stress and inflammation in the brain [46,47] . Acti-
vation of TLR4 by lipopolysaccharide was found to induce neuro -
inflammation and induce depressive-like behaviors in mice [48].To 
support the role of TLR4 on depression, a study of 92 young Scandina -
vian individuals found that greater depression scores were linked to 
reduced methylation of TLR4 in the blood [49]. TLR4 knockout mice 
exhibited elevated anxiety-like behavior and diminished social interac -
tion in comparison to wild-type control mice [50]. Furthermore, TLR4 
signaling contributes to the control of emotions by influencing the

8activity of DARPP-32, a central signaling pathway that is crucial for 
coordinating several neurotransmitter systems (e.g., glutamate and 
dopamine) [50]. Consistent with previous evidence, this study also 
found an association between TLR4 (rs2149351-T), mood disorders, and 
unipolar disorders. 
Using data from 2283 bipolar disorder cases, Schubert et al. observed 
that H3C12 (H3 Clustered Histone 12) gene was involved in histone 
biology, endocrine system disorders, and psychiatric traits (unipolar 
depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder) [51]. H3C12 
(rs483143-C) was observed in this analysis as the most important gene 
underlying the pathogenesis of mood disorders and unipolar depression. 
However, the specific mechanisms and their associations have not yet 
been fully elucidated. Thus, further work is needed to provide valuable 
insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying mood disorders 
associated with H3C12 (rs483143-C). 
RPS3 (ribosomal protein S3) is an essential constituent of the 40S 
subunit of the ribosome. RPS3 plays a crucial role in various cellular 
processes such as apoptosis/survival, transcriptional regulation, protein 
translation, host-pathogen interactions, DNA repair, and cell signaling [52,53] . Furthermore, RPS3 has raised attention to mood disorders. For 
example, a microarray analysis of 128 patients with unipolar depression 
and 64 controls observed that serum PRS3 was a potential biomarker for 
unipolar depression diagnosis (receiver operating characteristic curve 
was 0.833) [54]. Another cDNA microarray analysis observed reduced 
PRS3 expression in the hypothalamus of mice subjected to immobili -
zation stress [55]. The expression of RPS3 was also upregulated in the 
hippocampus of male mice with chronic social defeat stress [56]. 
Another analysis of 514 schizophrenia patients and 690 controls 
observed an association between RPS3 and signal recognition particle 
protein targeting the endoplasmic reticulum, ribosome, and schizo -
phrenia [57]. In line with these findings, this analysis also observed 
evidence of an increased risk of mood disorders among participants with 
the rs3018100-G variant of RPS3. 
CNTNAP2 (contactin-associated protein-like 2) is responsible for 
producing a transmembrane protein that facilitates communication be-
tween cells in the nervous system. Dysregulation of CNTNAP2 has been 
implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, unipolar depression, 
and autism [58–61]. NEGR1 (neuronal growth regulator 1) is considered 
Fig. 3. (continued ). H. Duc Nguyen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Personalized Medicine in Psychiatry 45-46 (2024) 100128
9a highly influential gene associated with the risk of unipolar depression 
[6]. ERBB4 (erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4), which encodes a re-
ceptor for neuregulin, had decreased expression in both the cortex and 
habenula regions in cases of unipolar depression [62]. Disruption of 
WWOX (WW domain containing oxidoreductase) gene leads to neuro -
developmental diseases (e.g., schizophrenia, epilepsy, and seizures), 
which involve abnormal differentiation and migration of neurons in the 
brain [63,64] . This study also found an association between CNTNAP2 
(rs11971943-G), ERBB4 (rs74865692-T), WWOX (rs7199110-A), and 
reduced risk of mood disorders and mixed traits, whereas there were 
associations between NERG1 (rs1620977-A), ERBB4 (rs11693031-A), 
WWOX (rs56858262-A), and increased risk of mood disorders and 
mixed traits. These findings suggest that CNTNAP2, ERBB4, WWOX, and 
NERG1 are potential biomarkers for managing mood disorders. 
Signaling pathways underlying the pathogenesis of mood disorders 
Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are class of transmembrane proteins 
that are situated on the surface of cells and play a crucial role in 
mediating cell–cell or cell-extracellular matrix interactions [65]. According to their distinct molecular structures, CAMs can be catego -
rized into four primary families: cadherins, integrins, selectins, and 
immunoglobulin-like CAMs [66]. CAMs have been found to facilitate 
cellular contacts with the extracellular environment, which are essential 
for regulating synaptic plasticity, and cellular activities, including sur-
vival, proliferation, activation, immune system response, inflammatory 
response, and neuronal growth inside the brain [67,68] . CAMs are 
known to have a significant impact on unipolar depression and schizo -
phrenia [69–71]. In this study, alteration of cell morphogenesis, cell 
projection organization, and cell adhesion involved in neuron differen -
tiation were listed as the predominant signaling pathways underlying 
the pathogenesis of mood disorders, unipolar depression, and mixed 
traits. To support these findings, NCAM1 is involved in cell adhesion, 
neurite outgrowth, neurogenesis, cell migration brain plasticity, uni-
polar depression, and mood disorder, which was a major gene in this 
study [28–32]. Variations or disruptions in NCAM1 can affect the in-
teractions and plasticity of neurons, as well as interfere with cellular 
adhesion, neurite outgrowth, and migration [28]. Furthermore, this 
study also observed that altered chemical synaptic transmission was 
involved in the pathogenesis of mood disorders. It can be explained by 
Fig. 3. (continued ). H. Duc Nguyen et al.

10dysfunctional synapse plasticity, which refers to the dynamic alterations 
in synapse structure and function [72]. Taken together, targeting the 
NCAM1 molecule is a possible avenue for the development of novel 
diagnostic approaches in the field of mood disorders. 
Glutamate severs act as the primary mediator of transmitting excit-
atory signals between synapses in the mammalian brain. The presyn -
aptic terminal releases glutamate, which then binds to and activates 
specific inotropic and metabotropic receptors on the postsynaptic 
membrane, which leads to various impacts on the excitability of neurons 
[73]. Increasing data suggests that the glutamatergic system plays a 
significant role in both the development and treatment of mood disor -
ders [74–76]. It has been known that metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) 
receptors establish connections with their effector mechanisms through 
G proteins. The activation of mGlu receptors leads to a coupling with 
intracellular second messengers, which in turn can induce long-term 
depression [77–79]. Moreover, it has been observed that there is a 
disruption in glutamatergic synaptic transmission in individuals with 
depression. Coinciding with this, our findings also found evidence of 
altered G-protein-coupled glutamate receptor activity underlying the 
pathogenesis of mood disorders, including unipolar depression and mixed traits. 
O-glycosylation refers to the enzymatic process of attaching O-gly -
cans, with a particular emphasis on N-acteylgalactosamine, to the hy-
droxyl groups of threonine and serine residues found in glycoproteins 
[80]. The process of O-glycosylation biosynthesis is primarily initiated 
within the Golgi apparatus, where the monosaccharide residues are 
added in a stepwise manner. O-glycosylation is a prevalent post-
translational modification observed in proteins that holds significant 
clinical relevance in the context of mood disorders [81]. Aberrant O- 
glycosylation has been identified as a contributing factors in neuropsy -
chiatric conditions, including autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, 
and depression [82–85]. An illustrative instance involves GALNT9, a 
gene mostly expressed in the brain that has been documented to exhibit 
an association with autism spectrum disorders [84,85] . In line with our 
findings, we also found an association between O-linked glycosylation 
and the pathogenesis of mixed traits.

11miRNAs and transcription factors underlying the pathogenesis of mood 
disorders 
A significant proportion, approximately 60 %, of these miRNAs are 
involved in the regulation of many neural processes, including neuro -
genesis and neuroplasticity [86]. Dysregulation of miRNA can lead to an 
impairment in the translation process and contribute to the development 
of many diseases, including mood disorders [23,87] . In this study, four 
miRNAs (hsa-miR-17-5p, hsa-miR-335-5p, hsa-miR-26b-5p, and hsa-let- 
7b-5p) were found to be implicated in the etiology of mood disorders, 
including unipolar depression and mixed traits. These miRNAs were 
found to be involved in numerous pathways associated with mood dis-
orders (glutamate receptor activity, Hedgehog signaling pathway, 
Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome, DNA damage response, and 
corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling pathway). In line with our 
findings, numerous studies have reported a link between hsa-miR-17-5p, 
hsa-miR-335-5p, hsa-miR-26b-5p, hsa-let-7b-5p, and mood disorders 
[88–90]. For example, an analysis of Japanese male participants (n 9, 
aged 27–37 years) observed the stability of miR-17-5p and miR-26b-5p 
in the blood samples. Remarkably, miR-17-5p expression was signifi -
cantly positively correlated with PHQ-9 scores (r 0.85, p D0.01) [88]. 
In the GSE182194 dataset, hsa-miR-3937, hsa-miR-4499, and hsa-miR- 7106-5p emerged as the top three significant miRNAs associated with 
mood disorders. These miRNAs have been implicated in regulating 
pathways involved in the pathogenesis of depression and have been 
identified as potential biomarkers in depression-cancer comorbidity, 
particularly through pathways such as IL-17 or histidine metabolism 
[91]. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the precise as-
sociation between these miRNAs and mood disorders. 
Transcription factors, similar to miRNAs, exhibit a multifaceted 
involvement in the pathogenesis of mood disorders. In this analysis, we 
observed three hub transcription factors (MYT1L, ZNF80A4, and 
NPAS3) underlying the etiology of mood disorders, which were in line 
with previous evidence. MYT1L belongs to the neural zinc finger tran-
scription factor family. MYT1L is distinguished by its possession of DNA- 
binding C2HC-type zinc fingers as well as a MYT1 domain, which is 
postulated to operate as a transcription repressor [92]. Duplication of 
MYT1L gene has been reported in schizophrenia patients, whereas 
impaired MYT1L gene function has been linked to intellectual impair -
ment and autism spectrum disorder [93]. ZNF804A encodes the zinc 
finger protein 804A in humans. Although the exact function of ZNF804A 
is not fully understood, accumulating evidence indicates a link between 
ZNF804A and mood disorders. For example, a meta-analysis study of 
65,240 cases of unipolar depression reported the association between 
Fig. 4.A network of MicroRNAs (A) and transcription factors (B) associated with genetic variations involved in the pathogenesis of mood disorders, unipolar 
depression, and mixed traits. Networks of miRNAs and transcription factors were assessed using 1505 genetic variations related to mood disorders, 825 genetic 
variations related to unipolar depression, and 155 genetic variations related to mixed traits. H. Duc Nguyen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Personalized Medicine in Psychiatry 45-46 (2024) 100128
12ZNF804A (rs1344706 and rs7597593) and mood disorders, including 
unipolar depression or bipolar depression [94]. Another analysis of 374 
Korean and 378 Italian patients with mood disorders also observed a 
relationship between ZNF804A (rs1344706) and mood disorders in both 
populations, as well as ZNF804A (rs7597593) and mood disorders in the 
Italian one [95]. The expression of NPAS3 plays an important role in 
brain function and has been observed in the postnatal brain (hippo -
campal and cortical interneurons) and in numerous locations of devel -
oping interneurons [96]. Thus, the association between loss of function 
of NPAS3, schizophrenia, and neuropsychiatric conditions has been re-
ported [97]. In line with our previous findings, hsa-miR-26b-5p and zinc finger 
protein (ZFF433, ZFF422, ZFF233, and ZFF331) were denoted as the key 
miRNAs and transcription factors that were found across two datasets 
(GSE101521, and GSE217811) implicated in the pathogenesis of mood 
disorder. Genetic differences, like SNPs or changes in miRNA sequences, 
can disrupt biological processes by affecting the miRNA targets, which is 
why they are closely linked to many human diseases [20]. In particular, 
SNPs found in areas connected to DNA methylation, transcription factor 
binding, or miRNA target sites can change how genes are expressed [25]. 
In the context of GWAS, miRNAs and transcription factors are increas -
ingly recognized for their potential regulatory roles in modulating gene

13expression and influencing disease susceptibility. While traditionally 
GWAS focus on identifying genetic variants associated with disease 
phenotypes, recent studies have begun to explore the regulatory net-
works involving miRNAs and transcription factors that may contribute 
to the observed associations [20,25] . Integrating miRNA and tran-
scription factor data with GWAS results can provide valuable insights 
into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases, 
shedding light on gene regulatory networks and potential therapeutic 
targets. However, it’s essential to exercise caution and ensure robust 
experimental validation, as the functional implications of miRNAs and 
transcription factors identified through GWAS may require further 
investigation to elucidate their precise roles in disease pathogenesis. 
In this study, a dataset consisting of 299 studies was employed in 
order to expand our understanding of the molecular pathways impli -
cated in gene variations among individuals diagnosed with mood dis-
orders. The aforementioned findings provide a basis for future research 
endeavors aimed at exploring potential biomarkers for the detection and 
management of mood disorders. However, this study relied on data 
obtained from the GWAS database. Therefore, the accuracy and quality of the interactions contained in this database play a crucial role in 
shaping our results. Although the findings on miRNAs and transcription 
factors align with previous research, it is imperative to conduct addi-
tional investigation in order to authenticate these results. Despite the 
comprehensive analysis of GWAS data from 299 studies, it is important 
to acknowledge that the current study primarily focused on genetic 
variations, and the exclusion of additional high-throughput analyses, 
such as DNA methylation and RNA sequencing, represents a limitation in 
capturing the full spectrum of molecular mechanisms underlying af-
fective disorders. The study ’s findings, while contributing to the un-
derstanding of genetic variations associated with mood disorders, lack 
direct experimental validation. Future research endeavors should pri-
oritize wet lab experiments to confirm the functional implications of 
identified risk alleles and associated molecular pathways. In light of the 
study ’s approach to categorizing individuals with mixed psychiatric 
diagnoses under “mixed traits, ” it is essential to acknowledge the 
inherent heterogeneity within this group, which may pose a limitation in 
capturing specific nuances related to distinct disorders. 
In conclusion, the present work entailed a comprehensive

14examination of data generated from the GWAS database, with the aim of 
identifying noteworthy genetic differences and elucidating the under -
lying molecular pathways connected with the etiology of mood disor -
ders arising from genetic variants. Ten common biomarkers (DCC, TCF4, 
SORCS3, RBFOX1, LINC03000, NIHCOLE, GRM5, RNU6-334P, 
TMEM106B, MPZL1, AKAP8P1, ADCY10, and JKAMPP1) associated 
with mood disorders were detected across all investigations. Within the 
realm of mood disorders, a set of biomarkers has been identified, with 
particular emphasis placed on seven core genetic abnormalities (DRD2 
(↑rs7125588-A or ↓rs7111031-C), PLCG1 (↑rs2228246-G), TLR4 
(↑rs2149351-T), H3C12 (↓rs483143-C), CNTNAP2 (↓rs11971943-G),

Significantly, a total of five hub biomarkers were shown to be associated 
with unipolar depression (NCAM1 (↑rs1940709-A or ↓rs9919557-T), 
TRL4 (↑rs2149351-T), DRD2 (↑rs7125588-A or ↓rs7111031-C), PLCG1 
(↑rs2228246-G), and H3C12 (↓rs483143-C)), while an additional five 
hub biomarkers were found to be associated with mixed traits (NCAM1 
(↑rs1940709-A or ↓rs9919557-T), NERG1 (↑rs1620977-A), ERBB4 
(↑rs11693031-A or ↓rs74865692-T), CNTNAP2 (↓rs11971943-G), and 
WWOX (↑rs56858262-A or ↓rs7199110-A)). Biomarkers that have been 
associated with an elevated susceptibility to mood disorders have been 
observed to interfere with many cellular processes, including cell 
morphogenesis, the organization of cell projections, and cell adhesion, 
all of which are crucial for the differentiation of neurons. The primary 
signaling pathways related to biomarkers underpinning a lower risk of 
mood disorders include activation of neuro projection morphogenesis, 
O-linked glycosylation, modulation of chemical synaptic transmission, 
and G-protein-coupled glutamate receptor activity. hsa-miR-3937, hsa- 
miR-4499, and hsa-miR-7106-5p was denoted as the most significant 
downregulations in the GSE182194 dataset. We identified significant 
microRNA (hsa-miR-26b-5p) and transcription factors (zinc finger pro-
teins) that play a crucial role in elucidating the genetic variants asso-
ciated with mood disorders across different datasets, including 
EFO_0003761, GSE101521, and GSE217811. The aforementioned find-
ings serve as a fundamental basis for potential therapeutic interventions 
targeting mood disorders, with a particular emphasis on the genetic 
variations and mechanisms associated with the condition.
