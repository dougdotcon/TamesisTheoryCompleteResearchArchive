# Structural Reduction: Riemann Hypothesis

## From Spectral Rigidity to Arithmetic Variance

**Conjecture Reference:** Millennium Problem 2 (Riemann Hypothesis)
**Reduction Strategy:** Arithmetic Variance Rigidity.

---

### 1. The Valid Reduction (Correct)

We have successfully mapped the physical "Spectral Rigidity" to the mathematical "Variance of the Error Term".

- **Mechanism:** Off-line zeros ($\sigma > 1/2$) generate terms $x^\sigma$ that cause the integrated variance $\int |E(x)|^2/x$ to diverge beyond the admissible $C \log T$ bound.
- **Support:** This mechanism is consistent with Random Matrix Theory (GUE) and Montgomery's Pair Correlation.

### 2. The Formal Gap (Open)

**The missing theorem:** The proof is conditional on unproven properties of the zeros.

- **Dependency:** "Assume the Pair Correlation Conjecture".
- **Status:** This assumes the statistical rigidity that we are trying to prove is universal. The bound $\int |E|^2/x \sim C \log T$ is not yet established unconditionally.
- **Requirement for Closure:** A proof of the Pair Correlation Conjecture for test functions with arbitrary support, or a direct bound on the variance without assuming RH.
- **Current State:** $RH \iff \text{Pair Correlation} + \text{Variance Control}$.
