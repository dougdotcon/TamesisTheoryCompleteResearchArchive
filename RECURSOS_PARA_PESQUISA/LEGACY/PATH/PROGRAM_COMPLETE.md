# RESEARCH TRILOGY STATUS: COMPLETE

## Part I: TAMESIS (Stages 1-42)

**Status:** CLOSED (Refuted)
**Conclusion:** No global Theory of Everything exists.
**Legacy:** Discovery of U_{1/2} and mechanism-driven universality.

## Part II: TRI (Stages 43-52)

**Status:** CLOSED (Proven)
**Conclusion:** Regimes are fundamentally incompatible.
**Legacy:** No-Go Theorems and the Regime Graph.

## Part III: TDTR (Stages 53-86)

**Status:** CLOSED (Validated)
**Conclusion:** Physics resides in the irreversible transitions between regimes.
**Legacy:**

- Resolution of Quantum Gravity (Emergent/Entropic).
- Explanation of Dark Matter (Elastic Memory).
- Constructive simulations of reality from information principles.
