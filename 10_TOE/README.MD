# ⚙️ THE ENGINE ROOM (TOE)

> **Role**: The Axiomatic Source
> **Connection**: `TOE` $\to$ `Kernel V3` $\to$ `Millennium Problems`

This directory contains the core strategic assets derived from the Theory of Everything (TOE) discovery. It serves as the "Axiom Set" from which the solutions to the Millennium Problems are derived via **Reverse Engineering**.

## 📂 File Structure

| File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`TACTICS_TOE_VS_CLAY.md`** | **The Hammer.** Explains how the TOE framework crushes the "Physics vs Math" barrier / ambiguity for each problem. |
| **`STRATEGY_REVERSE_ENGINEERING.md`** | **The Map.** Defines the strategy of "translating" the known physical solution into a formal mathematical conjecture, rather than solving from scratch. |
| **`RESEARCH_PROTOCOL.md`** | **The Sensor.** Instructions for finding existing academic literature that supports our specific "Physical" claims (keywords, authors, thesis search). |

## 🔗 The Logic Flow

1. **The Truth (TOE):** We assume the Universe is a Discrete Entropic Network (Kernel V3).
2. **The Prediction:** This network *cannot* support singularities (Navier-Stokes), infinite search w/o energy (P vs NP), or gapless gauge fields (Yang-Mills).
3. **The Proof:** We use the `Roadmaps` in the parent directory to translate these "Physical Impossibilities" into "Mathematical Obstructions".
