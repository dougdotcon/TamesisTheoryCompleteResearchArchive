# 🦅 RESEARCH PROTOCOL: Strategic Literature Search

> **Objective**: Locate the "Structural Mechanisms" in existing literature, bypassing the "Narrative Noise".

## 1. arXiv Strategy (The Signal Filter)

![Source](https://img.shields.io/badge/Source-arXiv-B31B1B?style=for-the-badge&logo=arxiv&logoColor=white) ![Filter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Filter-Mechanism_Only-green?style=for-the-badge)

arXiv alone is useless if you search for obvious keywords. We must search for *mechanisms*, not *conclusions*.

### ❌ Wrong Approach

* "Riemann Hypothesis solution"
* "P vs NP proof"

### ✅ Correct Approach (Structural Keywords)

* **Riemann:** `"spectral interpretation of zeta zeros"`, `"Hilbert-Polya operator"`, `"trace formula zeta"`, `"random matrix theory L-functions rigidity"`
* **Navier-Stokes:** `"entropy" + "Navier-Stokes" + "regularity"`
* **Yang-Mills:** `"mass gap" + "stability" + "measure selection"`

### 🧠 Advanced Technique: The Author Graph

When you find a high-signal paper:

1. Click on the **Author**.
2. Read their entire publication history.
3. Check **"Cited By"** to find who is continuing this specific line of thought.
*This reveals intellectual lineages rather than isolated papers.*

## 2. MathSciNet / Zentralblatt (The Reality Check)

These platforms are gold because they filter noise and provide **Critical Reviews**.

### What to Look For

Scan reviews for "polite rejections" that reveal structural barriers:

* *"Interesting idea, but..."*
* *"Fails to generalize to..."*
* *"The obstruction remains..."*

> **Insight:** These phrases point exactly to where the mathematical wall is located. That is where we attack.

## 3. Google Scholar (Reverse Engineering)

Use Scholar "backwards" to find the cutting edge.

### The Algorithm

1. Find a **Classic Paper** (e.g., Berry 1986).
2. Click **"Cited By"**.
3. Sort by **Date (Newest First)**.
4. **Ignore** the top-cited famous papers.
5. **Read** the obscure ones (5–30 citations).

**Why?** These obscure papers often contain active researchers trying new, experimental modifications that haven't been "accepted" by the consensus yet. This is where innovation hides.

## 4. PhD Theses (The Deep Mine)

Theses are underestimated. They contain:

* Calculations that were "too messy" for a paper.
* Negative results (what *didn't* work).
* Deep philosophical intuitions that journals rejected.

### Search Query

* `filetype:pdf "PhD thesis" + "Riemann Hypothesis" + "spectral"`
* `site:.edu "PhD thesis" + "Navier-Stokes" + "blowup"`

> **Rule:** If you understand a single PhD thesis deeply, you digest 10 years of a research lineage in one go.
