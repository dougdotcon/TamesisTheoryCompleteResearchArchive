## Abstract

We propose that the inverse-square law of gravity is not a fundamental postulate, but a necessary condition for the structural stability of a 3D vacuum manifold. By defining a "Structural Stress Functional" $\mathcal{S}[\alpha]$ associated with the oscillation damping of the vacuum, we demonstrate via the Calculus of Variations that the condition of minimal stress ($\delta \mathcal{S} = 0$) under isotropic symmetry significantly restricts the class of allowed potentials. We prove that the only solution satisfying both stability (boundedness at infinity) and continuity at the source is the Harmonic Potential $\Phi \propto 1/r$, which yields a force $F \propto 1/r^2$. This result suggests that General Relativity may be the effective field theory of a deeper control system that continually minimizes the informational stress of spacetime.

## Key Result (The Stability Theorem)

For a scalar stiffness field $\alpha(\mathbf{r})$ in $D=3$:
$$ \text{Minimize } \int (\nabla \alpha)^2 dV \implies \nabla^2 \alpha = 0 \implies \alpha(r) \sim \frac{1}{r} $$

**Status:** Certified Analytical Proof.
**Independence:** This theorem holds regardless of the validity of String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, or the Riemann Hypothesis.
