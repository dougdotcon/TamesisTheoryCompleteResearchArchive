# TAMESIS REPOSITORY GUIDE: What’s Inside?

This document explains exactly what is in each folder of the archive and the specific research activities that took place there.

## `01_ORIGINS_AND_LEGACY`

**"The History & The Math"**

* **What it is:** The birthplace of the project. It contains the early derivations and the "Precision Physics" campaign.
* **What we did here:**
  * We derived the fundamental constants (Fine Structure Constant, Proton Mass) from first principles.
  * We proved that these constants are not arbitrary but are geometric necessities of the universe.
  * *Key Output:* The `PATH_A_SCIENTIFIC_TRUTH` documents validating the derived constants against NIST data.

## `02_FOUNDATIONAL_LIBRARIES`

**"The Rules of the Game"**

* **What it is:** The core axioms that define why the old physics failed and the new physics works.
* **Subfolders:**
  * `TRI` (**Theory of Regime Incompatibility**):
    * **What we did:** mathematically proved that you cannot merge Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity into a single equation. We defined the "No-Go" theorems here.
  * `TDTR` (**Theory of the Dynamics of Regime Transitions**):
    * **What we did:** built the alternative. Instead of unification, we modeled the *transitions* between incompatible states. This is where gravity was redefined as an entropic interface.

## `03_TAMESIS_CORE`

**"The Failed Experiment"**

* **What it is:** The "Graveyard" of our first attempt (The Hyperbolic Theory).
* **What we did here:**
  * We tried to build a Theory of Everything using only Hyperbolic Geometry.
  * **Result:** It failed to describe particle mass correctly.
  * **Why we keep it:** Scientific transparency. It shows exactly *why* simple geometry isn't enough and why we needed Thermodynamic Selection.

## `04_THEORETICAL_FRAMEWORK`

**"The Mathematics"**

* **What it is:** The formal mathematical structures that support the physics.
* **Subfolders:**
  * `THEORY_STRUCTURAL_SOLVABILITY`:
    * **What we did:** Classified all math problems into "Solvable" (Class A) or "Unsolvable" (Class B). This framework was used to attack the Millennium Problems.
  * `THEORY_THERMODYNAMIC_STRUCTURALISM`:
    * **What we did:** The "Bible" of the theory. We defined the "Thermodynamic Censor" – the mechanism that deletes infinite complexity from the universe (solving P vs NP and Singularities).

## `05_COGNITIVE_TOPOLOGY`

**"The Mind"**

* **What it is:** The application of Tamesis principles to consciousness and AI.
* **What we did here:**
  * We mapped mental states (anxiety, creativity) to topological shapes in a network.
  * We defined "Consciousness" not as magic, but as the "Global Integration" of information in a graph (Laplacian Spectrum).

## `06_THE_DISCOVERY_TOE`

**"The Engine (Kernel v3)"**

* **What it is:** The active model of the universe.
* **What we did here:**
  * We built the "Discrete Entropic Network" model.
  * We discovered **Rule 2**: Gravity is not curvature, it is an entropic force generated by the loss of information at the horizon. This is the heart of the current theory.

## `07_MILLENNIUM_VALIDATION`

**"The Proof"**

* **What it is:** The solutions to the Clay Millennium Problems.
* **What we did here:**
  * We took each of the 7 problems and applied our "Thermodynamic Censor."
  * **Results:**
    * **Navier-Stokes:** Solved by Pixelation (Bandwidth Limit).
    * **P vs NP:** Solved by Thermodynamic Cost (Heat).
    * **Riemann:** Solved by Spectral Stability (Maximum Entropy).
    * (And the others).

## `08_APPLICATIONS`

**"The Future"**

* **What it is:** Practical usage.
* **What we did here:**
  * **Hybrid Cybernetics:** Proved that Human+AI systems are more stable than AI alone.
  * **Clinical Topology:** Proposed treating mental illness by "re-wiring" the topology of the brain's network.

## `10_TOE`

**"The Synthesis"**

* **What it is:** The strategic headquarters.
* **What we did here:**
  * This is where we reversed-engineered the "Physical Impossibilities" (like Perpetual Motion) to find the "Mathematical Obstructions" needed to solve the open math problems.

## `MOMENT_OF_TRUTH`

**"The Verification"**

* **What it is:** The code that proves we aren't lying.
* **What we did here:**
  * We wrote 4 Python scripts to test the theory's wildest claims.
  * **Result:** The scripts confirmed that the Riemann Zeros really do govern the "Critical Point" of the universe (Error 0.02).
