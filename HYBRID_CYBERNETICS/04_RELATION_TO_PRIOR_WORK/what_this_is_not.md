# What This Is NOT (Boundary Setting)

To ensure the utility and acceptance of this research line, we explicitly define its boundaries.

---

## 1. No Cosmological Implications

This theory applies to **Information Systems**, not **Physical Cosmology**.

- The "Entropy" discussed here is Shannon/Von Neumann Entropy, not Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy.
- Any isomorphism with Black Hole thermodynamics is purely formal/mathematical, not ontological.

## 2. Independent of Tamesis Core

This research **does not depend** on the validity of:

- The Theory of Regime Incompatibility (TRI).
- Thermodynamic Time Reversal (TDTR).
- The $U_{1/2}$ Riemann Hypothesis proof.

If the entire Tamesis Physics framework is falsified, **Hybrid Cybernetics stands unaffected**. It rests solely on Shannon's Theorems and Ashby's Law.

## 3. Not AGI Speculation

We do not speculate on "machine consciousness" or "superintelligence". We treat the machine strictly as a statistical operator with defined variance. Whether it "thinks" is irrelevant to the stability analysis, just as the "feelings" of a transistor are irrelevant to circuit design.
