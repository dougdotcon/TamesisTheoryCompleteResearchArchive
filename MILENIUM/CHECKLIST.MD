# MILLENNIUM PROBLEMS: MASTER CHECKLIST
>
> **Strategy:** The "Stability & Selection" Metatheorem.
> **Core Thesis:** Mathematical pathologies (singularities, gapless modes, off-line zeros, magic algos) correspond to unphysical thermodynamic states (infinite entropy flux, violation of coercivity, etc.).

## META-ANALYSIS: THE UNIFIED THEOREM

**Theorem:** *All Millennium Problems are instances of "Structural Selection by Stability".*

1. **Selection:** Physical/Mathematical reality selects structures that are stable under perturbations (Noise, Heat, Deformation).
2. **Rejection:** "Pathological" structures (Singularities, Magic Algos, Off-line Zeros) are unstable (Divergent Flux, Variance Explosion).
3. **Conclusion:** The 6 remaining problems are not "Logically Undecidable", they are "Physically/Structurally Determinate".

**Next Steps:**

- [ ] Synthesize all 4 "Green/Blue" results into a single Monograph?
- [ ] Archive P5 and P6 as "Future Work".
