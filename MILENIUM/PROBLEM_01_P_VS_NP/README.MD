# 🎱 PROBLEM 01: P vs NP

## The Thermodynamic Censorship

> **Status**: Metatheoretic Resolution Proposed via "Entropy Flux Divergence"
> **Core Thesis**: $P \neq NP$ because "Checking" allows entropy increase (Polynomial), while "Solving" requires entropy reduction (Exponential work against Thermal Noise).
