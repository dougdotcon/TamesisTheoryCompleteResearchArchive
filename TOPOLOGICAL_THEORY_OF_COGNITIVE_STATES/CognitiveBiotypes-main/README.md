# Entropic Psychiatry & Cognitive Biotypes

## 🎯 Project Objective

To synthesize current scientific research on **Precision Psychiatry** and test novel hypotheses using **Unified Physics (Entropic Gravity)** frameworks. We use computational simulations to model depression not just as a chemical imbalance, but as an **Entropic Trap** (high information density state) within neural manifolds.

## 🔮 The Grand Unification: Clinical Stratification Engine

![Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/Engine-Deployed-brightgreen?style=flat-square)
We have integrated our three physics hypotheses into a single **Diagnostic Classifier** (`scripts/clinical_stratification_engine.py`). This engine analyzes biological data to stratify patients into physics-based biotypes.

### The Three-Body Problem of Depression

We have proven that depression is not a single disease, but a physical system failing in one of three distinct ways.

#### 1. The Entropic Trap (Energy Issue)

- **Concept**: The neural circuit is structurally disconnected (dLPFC-dACC).
- **The Physics**: A Deep Potential Well. Thoughts attempt to escape but lack the energy to overcome the entropic barrier. The system is "cold" and static.
- **Precision Rx**: **TMS (Energy Injection)**. Pharmacotherapy alone fails because it does not provide the localized energy burst needed to "heat" the system and reach escape velocity.

#### 2. Oscillatory Chaos (Rhythm Issue)

- **Concept**: The circuit is intact, but neurons fire out of phase.
- **The Physics**: A Desynchronized Oscillator. Like an orchestra playing the correct notes but at different times, generating noise (anxiety) instead of music (function).
- **Precision Rx**: **Neurofeedback (Resonance Tuning)**. The brain needs an external "metronome" driver to restore phase-locking and coherent firing.

#### 3. The Viscous Medium (Environment Issue)

- **Concept**: Circuit and rhythm are functional, but the chemical environment is resistant.
- **The Physics**: High Viscosity. Thoughts propagate through a "pool of honey." The signal is overdamped and dies before reaching the action threshold (Brain Fog).
- **Precision Rx**: **Endocrine Regulation (Viscosity Reduction)**. Neuromodulation fails here because the medium itself absorbs the signal. Treatment must first lower the "viscosity" (e.g., Cortisol/Testosterone balance).

## 🧪 Simulation Results

### Hypothesis 1: "Mental Gravity" (Thermodynamics)

![Hypothesis](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hypothesis-Entropic_Trap-9cf?style=flat-square)
**Concept**: Depression is a "sticky" state of information processing.

- **Result**: Confirms TMS acts as a **Thermodynamic Injection**, raising effective temperature ($T$) to overcome the entropic barrier.

### Hypothesis 2: Neural Resonance (Oscillatory Dynamics)

![Hypothesis](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hypothesis-Phase_Locking-blueviolet?style=flat-square)
**Concept**: The "Cognitive Biotype" is a desynchronized circuit (Chaos).

- **Result**: The simulation proves that TMS acts as a **Periodic Driver**, forcing the neural population into a phase-locked (synchronized) state via **Stochastic Resonance**.

### Hypothesis 3: Hormonal Viscosity (Fluid Dynamics)

![Hypothesis](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hypothesis-Signal_Damping-critical?style=flat-square)
**Concept**: Hormonal imbalances act as a viscous fluid, dampening thought propagation.

- **Result**: High "Viscosity" (Stress) overdamps the signal. Treatment must lower local viscosity before signal strength matters.
