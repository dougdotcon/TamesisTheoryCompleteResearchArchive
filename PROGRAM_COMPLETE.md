# TAMESIS RESEARCH PROGRAM: FINAL STATUS

## Status: CLOSED

**Closure Date:** 2026-01-23  
**Final Stage:** 42  
**Primary Output:** Universality Atlas + U_{1/2} Discovery

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### What Was Discovered

1. **U_{1/2} Universality Class**
   - Formula: φ(c) = (1 + c)^{-1/2}
   - Applies to: Discrete-to-random transitions
   - Verified: α = 0.508 ± 0.033 (expected 0.500)

2. **Mechanism-Driven Universality**
   - Critical exponents encode mechanisms, not systems
   - Same system can have different exponents for different observables
   - Classification by: state space + perturbation + observable

3. **Atlas of 5 Classes**
   - U_{1/2}: Discrete counting (α = 0.5)
   - U_2: Lindblad dynamics (α = 2.0)
   - U_0: Threshold crossing (α ≈ 0)
   - U_exp: Poisson events (exponential)
   - U_Ising: Thermal disorder (α = 0.125)

### What Was Refuted

1. **Tamesis Action as ToE** (Stage 35)
   - Λ, a_0, M_c do NOT unify from single principle
   - Holographic unification fails for M_c by 24 orders of magnitude

2. **Universal applicability of U_{1/2}** (Stages 36-38)
   - Neural networks: different mechanism
   - Decoherence: α = 2.0 (Lindblad)
   - KAM chaos: α ≈ 0 (threshold)

## WHAT SURVIVES (PUBLISHABLE)

1. **Closure Paper** (Stage 42)
   - "Universality Classes Are Mechanism-Driven"
   - Self-contained, citeable, epistemologically honest

2. **U_{1/2} Mathematics** (Stage 34)
   - Rigorous result on cycle fraction in perturbed permutations
   - Could be submitted to combinatorics journals

3. **Negative Results** (Stages 31-33, 35, 38)
   - Scientific documentation of what doesn't work
   - Valuable for preventing future dead ends

---

## WHAT DOES NOT SURVIVE

1. ~~Tamesis Action as ToE~~ - REFUTED
2. ~~RH Proof attempt~~ - Not achieved (territory mapped correctly)
3. ~~P≠NP claims~~ - Never substantiated
4. ~~Holographic unification~~ - Fails catastrophically

## THE FINAL INSIGHT

> **"Universality is not global; it is conditional."**

The critical exponent emerges when three conditions align:
- State space type
- Perturbation type  
- Observable type

This is the organizing principle. It is:
- **Limited** (applies only when conditions align)
- **True** (verified numerically, bounded by negative results)
- **Closeable** (the program has converged)

## ACKNOWLEDGMENT

This program used LLMs as research amplifiers, not authorities.
All claims were tested computationally. False hypotheses were killed.
The methodology worked: a genuine discovery emerged from systematic exploration.
