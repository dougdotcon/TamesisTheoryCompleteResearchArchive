# Stage 44: Regime Invariants

## Status: IN PROGRESS

## Objective

Identify what does NOT change within a regime, and prove that changing an invariant changes the universality class.

## Key Invariants

| Invariant | Type | Values |
|-----------|------|--------|
| State Space Character | Structural | Discrete / Continuous |
| Quantumness | Structural | Quantum / Classical |
| Commutativity | Algebraic | Commutative / Non-commutative |
| Measure Type | Observational | Counting / Spectral / Threshold |
| Locality | Geometric | Local / Global |

## Connection to Stage 43

Stage 43 defined regimes as R = (S, P, O).
Stage 44 extracts the INVARIANTS from these components.

The invariants determine which universality class a regime belongs to.
