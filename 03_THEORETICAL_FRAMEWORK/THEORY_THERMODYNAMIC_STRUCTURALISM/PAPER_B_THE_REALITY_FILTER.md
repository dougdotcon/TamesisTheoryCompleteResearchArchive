# DOCUMENT B: THE REALITY FILTER

## Why Nature Rejects the Non-Realizable

> **Abstract:** This document provides the physical reasoning behind the Axioms of Realizability. We argue that the laws of Thermodynamics act as a "Great Filter" on the space of mathematical possibilities, allowing only stable, efficient structures to manifest as physical reality.

## 1. The Filter Mechanism

Mathematics allows for infinite precision, instantaneous updates, and unbounded singulatities. Physics does not.
Why?
Because Physics is constrained by **Information Processing Limits**.

### 1.1 The Landauer Wall

Every operation in the universe consumes resources.
If a mathematical structure (like an NP-Hard optimization) requires exponentially growing resources, it hits the **Landauer Wall**—the point where the energy required to process the next bit exceeds the available free energy of the local environment.

### 1.2 The Stability Selection

Nature selects for **Stability**.

* Unstable structures (Class NR) decay into thermal noise.
* Stable structures (Class R) persist and evolve.
The "Laws of Physics" are arguably just the set of rules describing the surviving structures (Survivorship Bias).

## 2. The Critical Instant

The "Critical Instant" ($\tau_c$) is the boundary condition of this filter.
It is the state of **Maximal Potential Realizability**.

* Maximum Entropy (Maximal Information Capacity).
* Maximum Connectivity (Maximal Causal Influence).
* Critical Point (Phase transition between Order and Chaos).

Objects like the **Riemann Zeta zeros** are "fossil records" of this Critical Instant. They encode the spectral signature of a system perfectly balanced on the edge of realizability.

## 3. Conclusion

Thermodynamic Structuralism is not about reducing Math to Physics. It is about recognizing that **Physical Reality is a Subset of Mathematical Possibility**, filtered by the cost of computation.
