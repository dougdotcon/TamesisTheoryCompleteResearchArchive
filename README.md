## Abstract

This repository constitutes the definitive archival record of the "Tamesis" research initiative (2024-2026). The project aimed to unify Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity through Spectral Geometry but concluded with a radical restructuring of physical foundations. The result is the **Theory of Regime Incompatibility (TRI)** and its dynamic extension, **Thermodynamic Time Reversal (TDTR)**.

This archive contains over 140 formal documents, derivations, and simulations proving that "Unification" is mathematically impossible, and that the universe is instead governed by irreversible transitions between incompatible vacuum regimes.

## 1. Visual Synthesis of the Theory

The following simulations visually summarize the three core pillars of the framework.

### I. Theory of Regime Incompatibility (TRI)

The universe is not a single continuous manifold. It is a quilt of distinct, incompatible physical regimes (phases). These regimes cannot interact directly; they are separated by domain walls where the laws of physics break down.

*Figure 1: Reaction-Diffusion simulation showing the eternal competition between incompatible vacuum phases. Note that boundaries fluctuate but phases never mix.*

### II. Thermodynamic Time Reversal (TDTR)

Time is not a dimension; it is an irreversible flow of information. The "Arrow of Time" is the gradient of the universe's expansion into the holographic void. This expansion drives the emergence of gravity and the selection of laws.

### III. The Tamesis System

Beneath the chaos of transitions lies a rigid number-theoretic skeleton. The Tamesis System describes the "Spectral Clockwork" — the prime number distribution that governs the stability of matter and the constants of nature.

## 2. Research Structure

The archive is organized into three sequential research programs.

### Part I: Tamesis Core (Stages 01-42)

*The Mathematical Engine*

- **Focus:** Spectral Geometry, Number Theory, and Computation.
- **Key Result:** Discovery of the $U_{1/2}$ Universality Class.
- **Outcome:** Provided the mathematical tools (Prime Spectral Operator) used in later stages.

### Part II: TRI (Stages 43-52)

*The Logic of Failure*

- **Focus:** Meta-Physics and Model Theory.
- **Key Result:** The "No-Go Theorems" proving that a static Theory of Everything is impossible.
- **Outcome:** Established that different physical regimes (e.g., Quantum vs. Gravity) are topologically distinct and require a transition map, not a unification.

### Part III: TDTR (Stages 53-86)

*The Dynamic Solution*

- **Focus:** Dynamics, Entropy, and Cosmology.
- **Key Result:** The reformulation of Gravity as an Entropic Force and Time as Information Loss.
- **Outcome:** Validated against Galaxy Rotation Curves without Dark Matter.
