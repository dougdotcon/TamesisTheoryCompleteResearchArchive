# TRI — Theory of Regime Incompatibility

## Program Status: COMPLETE

**Stages 43-52 | 2026-01-23**

---

## Central Thesis

> **There exists no single axiomatic framework capable of describing all physical regimes simultaneously, because the fundamental mechanisms that define each regime are mathematically incompatible.**

---

## What TRI Proves

### Three No-Go Theorems

1. **Discrete-Continuous No-Go**: Regimes with discrete state spaces cannot be unified with continuous state spaces.

2. **Quantum-Gravity No-Go**: QFT and GR have incompatible invariants that prevent unified formulation.

3. **Universality Class Exclusion**: Each transition belongs to exactly one universality class. No master class contains all others.

### Why All ToEs Fail

| Theory | Theorem Violated |
|--------|------------------|
| String Theory | Quantum-Gravity No-Go |
| Loop Quantum Gravity | Discrete-Continuous No-Go |
| Tamesis Action | Universality Class Exclusion |

## Program Summary

| Phase | Stages | Content |
|-------|--------|---------|
| I | 43-45 | Formalization: R = (S, P, O), invariants, regime map |
| II | 46-48 | Incompatibility: compatibility criterion, no-go theorems, ToE failures |
| III | 49-50 | Transitions: graph structure, local universality |
| IV | 51-52 | Consolidation: founding paper, closure |

## Key Insight

> *"The unity of physics is not in the laws, but in the limits of what can coexist."*
