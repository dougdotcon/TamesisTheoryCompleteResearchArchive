# STAGE 1: DEFINING THE PIXEL ($M_c$)

**Status:** INITIALIZING

## Objective

Derive the Critical Mass $M_c$ where quantum coherence spontaneously breaks into classical reality.

## The Theory

We hypothesize $M_c$ is not arbitrary, but the **geometric mean** of the Universe's mass scales, or a resonance of the Planck Mass in a hyperbolic vacuum.

## Execution Plan

1. **Derivation:**
    - Use Dimensional Analysis on $(G, \hbar, \Lambda)$.
    - Calculate theoretical value of $M_c$.
    - Target: $\approx 5.29 \times 10^{-16}$ kg.

2. **Validation:**
    - Compare with Planck Mass resonance: $M_c \approx m_P \times (\text{Volume Factor})$.
    - Check against Penrose-Diosi collapse objective reduction threshold.

3. **Output:**
    - `derivation_mc.py`: Python script for high-precision calculation.
    - `Mc_Technical_Report.md`: Narrative-free derivation proof.
