* **Description (Abstract):**
    > We present a unified model of the universe as a distributed computational system operating on a discrete informational graph, termed the "Tamesis Kernel". We demonstrate that the smooth manifold of General Relativity is not fundamental but an emergent statistical property of the graph in the thermodynamic limit. We explicitly derive the Einstein Field Equations with an entropic correction term and map the Standard Model to topological defects in the graph connectivity. This framework resolves the conflict between Locality and Continuity (TRI) and provides testable predictions for Planck-scale Lorentz violations.

    > **Executive Summary:**
    > **Tamesis** reconfigures physics as a computational process. We demonstrate that Spacetime ($g_{\mu\nu}$), Matter ($\pi_n$), and Gravity ($T_{\mu\nu}^{(info)}$) are emergent statistical properties of a discrete informational graph (The Kernel) minimizing its processing cost. Unlike geometric unifications, Tamesis is built on *falsifiability*, predicting observable spectral lags in Gamma-Ray Bursts ($\Delta t \sim 10^{-15}s$) and vacuum birefringence, bridging the gap between Quantum Information and General Relativity.
