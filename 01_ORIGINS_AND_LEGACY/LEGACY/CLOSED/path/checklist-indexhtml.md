# Tamesis Canon: The Consolidated Publication Plan

> **Strategic Decision:** To avoid the "fragmentation trap" and ensure the highest scientific impact, we are consolidating the research into **12 Definitive Treatises**. We will not publish "notes" or "drafts"; we will publish **Resolutions**.

## Volume I: The Foundations (Completed)

- [x] **Treatise 1:** `02_FOUNDATIONAL_LIBRARIES/TRI/paper.html` (Regime Incompatibility)
- [x] **Treatise 2:** `02_FOUNDATIONAL_LIBRARIES/TDTR/paper.html` (Dynamics of Transitions)
- [x] **Treatise 3:** `01_ORIGINS_AND_LEGACY/PATH_A_SCIENTIFIC_TRUTH/paper.html` (Precision Physics)
- [x] **Treatise 4:** `01_ORIGINS_AND_LEGACY/UNIFIED_THEORY/paper.html` (Structural Selection - Early Draft)

## Volume II: The Theoretical Framework

**Goal:** Merge the fragmented "Papers A/B/C" into unified, rigorous theory documents.

- [x] **Treatise 5: The Theory of Structural Solvability**
  - *Source:* `04_THEORETICAL_FRAMEWORK/THEORY_STRUCTURAL_SOLVABILITY`
  - *Merge:* Paper 01 (Foundations) + Paper 02 (Barriers) + Paper 03 (Selection).
  - *Output:* `04_THEORETICAL_FRAMEWORK/THEORY_STRUCTURAL_SOLVABILITY/paper.html`

- [x] **Treatise 6: The Principles of Thermodynamic Structuralism**
  - *Source:* `04_THEORETICAL_FRAMEWORK/THEORY_THERMODYNAMIC_STRUCTURALISM`
  - *Merge:* Paper A (Realizability) + Paper B (Reality Filter) + Paper C (TSR Test).
  - *Output:* `04_THEORETICAL_FRAMEWORK/THEORY_THERMODYNAMIC_STRUCTURALISM/paper.html`

## Volume III: The Architecture of Reality

- [x] **Treatise 7: The Computational Architecture (Toe)**
  - *Status:* **Ready** (`11_TOE/paper.html` and `10_TOE/paper.html`)

## Volume IV: The Millennium Resolutions

**Goal:** One definitive paper per problem. No "updates", only "closures".

- [x] **Treatise 8: The Resolution of the P vs NP Problem**
  - *Source:* `07_MILLENNIUM_VALIDATION/PROBLEM_01_P_VS_NP`
  - *Merge:* Paper A (Complexity Censorship) + Paper B (Thermodynamics) + Closure.
  - *Output:* `07_MILLENNIUM_VALIDATION/PROBLEM_01_P_VS_NP/paper.html`

- [x] **Treatise 9: The Thermodynamic Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis**
  - *Source:* `07_MILLENNIUM_VALIDATION/PROBLEM_02_RIEMANN`
  - *Merge:* Paper A (Exclusion) + Paper B (Motivation) + Theory Critical Instant.
  - *Output:* `07_MILLENNIUM_VALIDATION/PROBLEM_02_RIEMANN/paper.html`

- [x] **Treatise 10: Regularity of Navier-Stokes via Regime Incompatibility**
  - *Source:* `07_MILLENNIUM_VALIDATION/PROBLEM_03_NAVIER_STOKES`
  - *Merge:* Paper A (Regime Incompatibility) + Paper B (No-Go) + Discrete Viscosity.
  - *Output:* `07_MILLENNIUM_VALIDATION/PROBLEM_03_NAVIER_STOKES/paper.html`

- [x] **Treatise 11: Mass Gap and Coercivity in Yang-Mills Theory**
  - *Source:* `07_MILLENNIUM_VALIDATION/PROBLEM_04_YANG_MILLS`
  - *Merge:* Paper B (Suppression) + Spectral Bounds + Closure.
  - *Output:* `07_MILLENNIUM_VALIDATION/PROBLEM_04_YANG_MILLS/paper.html`

## Volume V: Cognitive Physics

- [x] **Treatise 12: The Topological Theory of Cognitive States**
  - *Source:* `05_COGNITIVE_TOPOLOGY`
  - *Merge:* Theory Foundation + Paper A + Paper B.
  - *Output:* `05_COGNITIVE_TOPOLOGY/paper.html`

**Strategy Note:** Roadmaps, logs, and "drafts" remain as internal artifacts but are NOT published as papers. This reduces the workload by 80%.
