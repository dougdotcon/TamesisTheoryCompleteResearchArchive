# HOW TO USE: Tamesis Theory Research Archive

## Overview

Welcome to the **Tamesis Theory Complete Research Archive**. This repository contains the complete scientific and mathematical development of the Tamesis Theory, a framework that unifies physics and information theory through the lens of thermodynamic structuralism.

The archive documents the full journey from the initial "Tamesis Core" (Refuted) to the final **"Unified Theory of Structural Selection"**, the resolution of the **Millennium Prize Problems**, the decoding of **Ancient Civilizations as Technological Archives**, **AI Alignment as Topological Attractor**, and the **Thermodynamics of Consciousness**.

**Version:** 2.0 (February 2026)

## Getting Started

To understand the scope and results of this research, we recommend reading the documentation in the following order:

### 1. The Timeline and Logic

* **Start here:** `RESEARCH_CHRONOGRAM.md`
  * This file provides a chronological roadmap of the entire project.
  * It explains the evolution of ideas, from early failures (Stage 35) to the final validation (Stage 78+).
  * Use this to identify which folders contain "Legacy" code versus "Active" theory (TRI, TDTR, TOE).

### 2. The Main Results

* **Read next:** `MILLENNIUM_RESOLUTIONS.md`
  * This is the technical summary of the project's major achievement: the resolution of the 7 Millennium Prize Problems.
  * It explains the physics-based logic (Thermodynamic Censorship, Spectral Coercivity) used to solve or close each mathematical problem.

### 3. The Structure

* **Reference:** `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md`
  * Use this to navigate the directory tree. It maps the conceptual hierarchy to the file system.
