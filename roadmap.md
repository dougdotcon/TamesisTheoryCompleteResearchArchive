# Roadmap: Stages 10-14 — The Hyperbolic ToE Construction

## STATUS: SUPERSEDED

> **This roadmap has been superseded by the final program closure.**
>
> The ToE approach was REFUTED in Stage 35.
> See `PROGRAM_COMPLETE.md` for the actual outcome.

## What This Roadmap Proposed

Stages 10-14 proposed constructing a Theory of Everything based on:

- Hyperbolic geometry (SL(2,Z) \ H)
- Laplacian eigenvalues (Maass forms)
- Connection to Riemann zeros

## What Actually Happened

| Stage | Proposed | Actual Outcome |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| 10-14 | ToE via hyperbolic geometry | Stages completed but approach abandoned |
| 35 | - | Tamesis Action as ToE REFUTED |
| 34-41 | - | U_{1/2} universality class discovered |
| 42 | - | Program closed with closure paper |

## The Real Outcome

The research program converged on a different discovery:

**U_{1/2} Universality Class**: phi(c) = (1 + c)^{-1/2}

This was NOT the expected outcome, but represents genuine scientific discovery.
