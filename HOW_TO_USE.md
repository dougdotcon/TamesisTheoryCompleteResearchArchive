# HOW TO USE: Tamesis Theory Research Archive

## Overview

Welcome to the **Tamesis Theory Complete Research Archive**. This repository contains the complete scientific and mathematical development of the Tamesis Theory, a framework that unifies physics and information theory through the lens of thermodynamic structuralism.

The archive documents the full journey from the initial "Tamesis Core" (Refuted) to the final **"Unified Theory of Structural Selection"** and the resolution of the **Millennium Prize Problems**.

## Getting Started

To understand the scope and results of this research, we recommend reading the documentation in the following order:

### 1. The Timeline and Logic

* **Start here:** `RESEARCH_CHRONOGRAM.md`
  * This file provides a chronological roadmap of the entire project.
  * It explains the evolution of ideas, from early failures (Stage 35) to the final validation (Stage 78+).
  * Use this to identify which folders contain "Legacy" code versus "Active" theory (TRI, TDTR, TOE).

### 2. The Main Results

* **Read next:** `MILLENNIUM_RESOLUTIONS.md`
  * This is the technical summary of the project's major achievement: the resolution of the 7 Millennium Prize Problems.
  * It explains the physics-based logic (Thermodynamic Censorship, Spectral Coercivity) used to solve or close each mathematical problem.

### 3. The Structure

* **Reference:** `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md`
  * Use this to navigate the directory tree. It maps the conceptual hierarchy to the file system.

## Repository Structure Guide

The repository is organized by "Stages of Truth":

### A. Core Theory (Active)

* **`02_FOUNDATIONAL_LIBRARIES/`**: The bedrock of the new physics.
  * `TRI`: Theory of Regime Incompatibility (why we can't have one equation for everything).
  * `TDTR`: Theory of the Dynamics of Regime Transitions (how to move between regimes).
* **`04_THEORETICAL_FRAMEWORK/`**: The mathematical formalism.
  * `THEORY_STRUCTURAL_SOLVABILITY`: Why some problems are solvable and others aren't.
  * `THEORY_THERMODYNAMIC_STRUCTURALISM`: The main thesis ("The Universe is a thermodynamically selected subset of Mathematics").

### B. The Discovery & Validation (Active)

* **`06_THE_DISCOVERY_TOE/`**: The "Kernel v3" model of the universe as a Discrete Entropic Network.
* **`07_MILLENNIUM_VALIDATION/`**: The rigorous application of the theory to the Clay Millennium Problems.
* **`MOMENT_OF_TRUTH/`**: Python experiments that validated the core axioms (Spectral Criticality, Big Bounce, etc.).

### C. Applications (Active/Planned)

* **`08_APPLICATIONS/`**: Practical uses of the theory.
  * `HYBRID_CYBERNETICS`: Stability of Human-AI systems.
  * `APPLICATIONS_CLINICAL_TOPOLOGY`: Applications in neuroscience/psychiatry.

### D. Legacy & Refuted (Historical)

* **`03_TAMESIS_CORE/`**: The old "Hyperbolic ToE" (Refuted). Kept for historical transparency.
* **`01_ORIGINS_AND_LEGACY/`**: Early derivations and the "Precision Physics" path.

## How to Verify

For researchers looking to verify the results:

1. Navigate to `MOMENT_OF_TRUTH/`.
2. Run the Python scripts (e.g., `EXP_01_spectral_criticality.py`) to reproduce the statistical validation of the Tamesis axioms.
3. Check `07_MILLENNIUM_VALIDATION/` for specific problem reductions (e.g., Navier-Stokes).
