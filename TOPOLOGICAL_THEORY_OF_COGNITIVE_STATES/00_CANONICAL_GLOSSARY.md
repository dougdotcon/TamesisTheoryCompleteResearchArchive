# Canonical Glossary of the Topological Theory of Cognitive States

## 1. Core Physical Variables (The Syntax)

These are the fundamental units of the theory. They are non-negotiable and measurable.

| Symbol | Canonical Name | Operational Definition | Neurobiological Correlate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$N$** | **Node** | Discrete unit of local state processing ($n_i$). | Neural assembly / ROI / Voxel column. |
| **$E$** | **Edge** | Directed channel of causal influence ($e_{ij}$). | Functional Connectivity (Synaptic weight/coherence). |
| **$I$** | **Signal Information** | Reduction in uncertainty ($H_{max} - H_{obs}$). | Signal variability / Entropy of firing rates. |
| **$C_{max}$** | **Channel Capacity** | Upper bound of $I_{flow}$ per edge/node. | Metabolic limit (ATP/Oxygen) or Refractory period. |
| **$\lambda$** | **Eigenvalue** | Resonant frequency of the Laplacian ($L$). | EEG Band Power / Oscillatory Mode. |
| **$Q$** | **Modularity** | Degree of network segregation. | Hemisphere specialization / Functional segregation. |
| **$\lambda_2$** | **Algebraic Connectivity** | Speed of global diffusion (Fiedler value). | Global Integration / Synchrony capability. |

## 2. Phenomenological Regimes (The Semantics)

Mappings between topological states and subjective experience.

| Clinical / Subjective Term | Topological Definition | Spectral Signature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Normal Consciousness** | Critical Regime (Small-World). Balance of $Q$ and $\lambda_2$. | Power-law distribution ($1/f$ noise). |
| **Anxiety** | **Overfitting Regime**. High Clustering ($C$), short paths loops. | High Gamma power in local hubs, low global damping. |
| **Depression (Entropic Trap)** | **Deep Attractor**. High energy cost to switch states. Disconnected hubs. | Low variability, dominant low-frequency, rigid topology. |
| **Depression (Viscosity)** | **Overdamped Regime**. Signals decay before $t_{action}$. | Flattened spectrum, low amplitude across bands. |
| **Mania / Psychosis** | **Hypersynchrony / Randomness**. Low $Q$, indiscriminate $E$. | Whitening of spectrum (Noise) or massive hypersync (Seizure). |
| **Dissociation** | **Modular Fragmentation**. $\lambda_2 \to 0$. $G$ splits into $G_1, G_2$. | Loss of coherence between Frontal/Parietal modes. |
| **Insight ("Aha!")** | **Global Phase Transition**. Sudden creation of long-range shortcut. | Spike in $\lambda_2$, avalanche of information flow. |

## 3. Cognitive Biotypes (The Clinical Map)

Integration with the *Cognitive Biotypes* research line.

| Biotype Name | Physical Mechanism | Treatment Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Entropic Trap** | **Topology Issue**. Deep potential well ($V$). Barrier height $\Delta E > kT$. | **Energy Injection** (TMS). Needs activation energy to escape local minimum. |
| **Oscillatory Chaos** | **Phase Issue**. Desynchronized coupled oscillators. | **Driver Entrainment** (Neurofeedback/tACS). Needs external metabolic metronome. |
| **Viscous Medium** | **Damping Issue**. Permittivity $\epsilon$ of the medium is too low. | **Viscosity Reduction** (Endocrine/Metabolic). Signal boosting is futile if damping is high. |

## 4. Definitions of "Magic Words"

We strictly define terms that are usually vague.

* **Attention**: Not a "spotlight", but a **Flow Limiting Mechanism**. It is the active suppression of $N-1$ channels to prevent $I > C_{max}$ in the remaining channel.
* **Memory**: Not a "drawer", but the **Hysteresis** of the network topology. The current structure $E_t$ is a function of past flows $I_{t-k}$.
* **Consciousness**: The state of **Global Structured Integration**, where local nodal information determines global network trajectory.
* **Will (Free Will)**: The capacity of the internal network topology to act as a hidden variable determining $S_{t+1}$, independent of immediate $I_{input}$.

## 5. Axiomatic Rules

1. **No Psychology Rule**: Never use a psychological term if a topological one suffices. (e.g., say "High Modularity", not "Dissociation").
2. **Finitude Rule**: All capacities $C$ are finite. Infinite bandwidth constructs are forbidden.
3. **Physicality Rule**: Information is physical and has metabolic mass/cost.
